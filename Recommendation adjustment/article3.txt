ABSTRACT
Personalized learning (PL) aspires to provide an alternati ve to the one-size-ﬁts-all approach in ed-
ucation. Technology-based PL solutions have shown notable effectiveness in enhancing learning
performance. However, their alignment with the broader goa ls of modern education is inconsistent
across technologies and research areas. In this paper, we ex amine the characteristics of AI-driven
PL solutions in light of the OECD Learning Compass 2030 goals . Our analysis indicates a gap be-
tween the objectives of modern education and the current dir ection of PL. We identify areas where
most present-day PL technologies could better embrace esse ntial elements of contemporary educa-
tion, such as collaboration, cognitive engagement, and the development of general competencies.
While the present PL solutions are instrumental in aiding le arning processes, the PL envisioned by
educational experts extends beyond simple technological t ools and requires a holistic change in the
educational system. Finally, we explore the potential of la rge language models, such as ChatGPT,
and propose a hybrid model that blends artiﬁcial intelligen ce with a collaborative, teacher-facilitated
approach to personalized learning.

1 Introduction
Prominent educational researchers and organizations agre e that education must be learning-centered for every pupil t o
reach their potential (Bransford et al., 2000; Groff, 2017; O’Brien et al., 2009; OECD, 2006; Vygotsky & Cole, 1978).
The learning-centered paradigm stems from changes in indus try and society: The predominantly knowledge-based
form of work requires an education system that values indivi dual differences and promotes lifelong learning skills
(Lee, 2014). Since early experiments demonstrated the bene ﬁts of one-on-one tutoring over group-level instruction
(Bloom, 1984; Salvin & Karweit, 1985), researchers have sou ght technological solutions to achieve cost-effective
personalized tutoring (Lee et al., 2018). Personalized lea rning (PL) aims to achieve this goal by tailoring instructio n,
pace, methods, and content to the interests, needs, and goal s of individual learners (Beese, 2019; US Department of
Education, 2010; Walkington & Bernacki, 2020). Breakthrou ghs in technology and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) have led
to a rapid increase in the applications of PL (Chen et al., 202 0). AI-driven adaptive learning systems (Corbett et al.,
1997; Maghsudi et al., 2021; VanLehn, 2011) have emerged to p rovide learners with individualized lesson sequences,
content recommendations, tasks, and automated assessment s (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). A prevailing view in the
application of AI to Education (AIEd) literature is that per sonalized adaptive learning systems increase access to hig h-
quality education and are contrasted with a “traditional,” one-size-ﬁts-all approach (Tetzlaff et al., 2020; Maghsud i
et al., 2021; St-Hilaire et al., 2022). However, previous re views have pointed to limited analysis of the educational
underpinnings of AIEd (Chen et al., 2020; Hinojo-Lucena et a l., 2019; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).APREPRINT - APRIL 4, 2024
Here, we analyze the PL approach from the perspective of the e ducational goals set by the OECD Learning Com-
pass 2030 as a framework to support our arguments (OECD, 2019 b). In addition to core knowledge and skills, the
framework highlights three main goals of education: focus o n general competencies, developing learners’ agency, and
building on the Anticipation-Action-Reﬂection (AAR) cycl e. First, the AAR cycle reﬂects the need for deeper cogni-
tive engagement before and during learning (Bransford et al ., 2000; Chi & Wylie, 2014; Dehaene, 2020), also known
as active learning. Second, agency is a broad and interdisci plinary term that denotes the skills necessary for lifelong
learning (Brod et al., 2023; Council of the EU, 2002; OECD, 20 06). An essential part of agency is related to self-
directed and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills that ena ble the learner to take the initiative in leading their learn ing,
monitor their level of understanding, setting goals, plann ing tasks, and taking action toward them, and evaluate their
performance (Knowles, 1975; Zimmerman, 1986, 2000; Saks & L eijen, 2014; Panadero, 2017). It has been consis-
tently shown that without proper SRL skills, learners overw helmingly choose the least effective strategies for learni ng
(McCabe, 2011). Third, we deﬁne general competencies as per sonal attributes or behaviors developed through action,
experience, and reﬂection (UNESCO, 2017). Examples of thes e competencies include critical thinking, collaboration
skills, creating new value, and complex problem-solving sk ills (OECD, 2019b; UNESCO, 2022). We will expand and
use these overarching goals in our analysis of the challenge s of personalized learning systems.
We recognize the value of PL technologies as supportive tool s for teachers and effective knowledge acquisition, par-
ticularly when they promote self-regulated learning, enha nce learner’s agency, and engage students cognitively (e.g .,
Azevedo et al., 2022; Biswas et al., 2016; du Boulay, 2019; Lo ng & Aleven, 2017). The beneﬁts of AI-enabled
PL systems are manifold, including ﬂexibility in time and lo cation, timely feedback, and faster student progression
(Moreno-Guerrero et al., 2020; Pliakos et al., 2019), offer ing a more dynamic approach to knowledge acquisition com-
pared to traditional methods. However, PL is described as an AI-based individualized learning approach and is often
used synonymously with “adaptive learning” (Bernacki et al ., 2021; Maghsudi et al., 2021; Shemshack et al., 2021;
Shemshack & Spector, 2020; Tetzlaff et al., 2021). Rather th an being the antithesis of the traditional one-size-ﬁts-al l
approach, PL, as currently implemented, is simply a more eff ective method of knowledge acquisition. In contrast to
the PL as currently implemented, the “ideal” personalized l earning adheres to all principles of modern learning and as-
pires to a broader change in the school, educational strateg y, curricula, effective pedagogies, etc., in which technol ogy
plays only a supporting role (Hopkins, 2010; Lee, 2014; Lee e t al., 2018; Miliband, 2006; Watters, 2023).
We explore this perspective by examining how the PL literatu re emphasizes certain aspects of modern education while
neglecting others. AIEd is still in its infancy, and there is an opportunity to guide its development in line with the
principles of contemporary education (Shemshack et al., 20 21; Cukurova et al., 2023). In the concluding sections, we
explore the potential of large language models (such as Chat GPT) and propose a hybrid framework that envisions a
collaborative relationship between AI and teachers.
2 Beneﬁts of personalized learning systems
The framework for personalized learning was outlined in the early 1960s in Richard D. Smallwood’s dissertation on
“teachable machines” (Smallwood, 1962). As envisioned by S mallwood, these machines would provide an individu-
alized pace of learning, apply repetition until mastery, pr ovide immediate feedback, and record student performance
(Smallwood, 1962, pp. 2–3 as cited by Essa 2016). The need for individualized learning was fueled by experiments
that demonstrated higher learning gains in 1:1 tutoring tha n in traditional group instruction, named the 2-sigma prob-
lem (Bloom, 1984; Salvin & Karweit, 1985). Today, Smallwood ’s vision is reﬂected in the widely used deﬁnition
of the U.S. Department of Education (2010, 2017), which refe rs to PL as “instruction in which the pace of learning
and the instructional approach are optimized for the needs o f each learner.” While this deﬁnition does not emphasize
individualization per se, a superﬁcial understanding of PL as a technology-facilitated, individualized, and automat ed
approach is prevalent in the AIEd literature (Lee et al., 201 8; Shemshack & Spector, 2020; Tetzlaff et al., 2021).
The individualized approach has several advantages over gr oup-level instruction (Luckin et al., 2016). Typical PL
systems include three core components: a content model, a st udent model, and a pedagogical model (Martin et al.,
2020). The pedagogical model identiﬁes and sequences learn ing objectives, guides learners through individual learn-
ing paths, and provides timely feedback and assessment (Ezz aim et al., 2022; Martin et al., 2020; Pelánek, 2017). The
pedagogical model usually provides distributed practice u ntil the learning objective is mastered, an effective learn ing
strategy for long-lasting comprehension and memory format ion (Dempster & Farris, 1990; Gerbier & Toppino, 2015;
Hintzman, 1974; Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015; Srinivasan, 2022 ; Tetzlaff et al., 2021). The pedagogical model provides
continuous corrective feedback, a highly effective teachi ng strategy for empowering learners to improve their under-
standing (Dehaene, 2020; Hattie, 2011; Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Osakwe et al., 2022). The student model stores
learner characteristics and tracks the learner’s evolving level of understanding (Greer & McCalla, 1991). Together
with the pedagogical model, dynamic student models allow ta sk difﬁculty to be adapted to the individual’s zone of
proximal development, where tasks are neither too boring no r too difﬁcult to cause discouragement, making learning
2APREPRINT - APRIL 4, 2024
naturally engaging and challenging (Bransford et al., 2000 ; Vygotsky & Cole, 1978). The individual learning steps
are recommendations on the content model, a digitized, conn ected domain knowledge graph (Bartl & Belohlavek,
2011). The presentation of appropriate levels of tasks is co ntinued until the student has mastered the topic at hand
(Shute & Towle, 2010). In short, PL systems that monitor each student’s progress and adapt learning content, methods,
and assessment to individuals on an ongoing basis (Shemshac k & Spector, 2020; Xie et al., 2019; Vandewaetere &
Clarebout, 2013) are efﬁcient for mastering domain knowled ge and improving learning performance (Walkington &
Bernacki, 2020; Cui et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018; Steenber gen-Hu & Cooper, 2014; Urh et al., 2015).
In addition, there are necessary theoretical guidances and empirical basis for designing learning environments that
foster self-regulation and metacognition (for a comprehen sive overview, see Azevedo & Aleven, 2013). Scaffolding
SRL behaviors has been an important research focus on intell igent learning environments and ITS. For instance, much
work has been done with an ITS called MetaTutor that scaffold s SRL processes, such as goal setting, evaluation of
learning strategies, self-monitoring of progress, and sup ports cognitive processes of learning required for long-te rm
memory retention, e.g., note-taking, connecting prior and new knowledge, hypothesis generation (Azevedo et al.,
2022). Extending domain-level ITS systems with metacognit ive tutoring has positively affected student help-seeking
strategies and learning outcomes (Aleven et al., 2006; Hack er et al., 2009; Roll et al., 2007). Extensive studies
have been done with a cognitive science tutoring system call ed Betty’s Brain, where middle-school students learn
by teaching a virtual agent and creating causal models (Bisw as et al., 2005). For example, Leelawong & Biswas
(2008) showed that Betty’s Brain led to higher performance a nd skill transfer to novel domains with self-regulation
features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and self-a ssessment. In Betty’s Brain, students must also develop and
apply metacognitive strategies for goal setting, planning , and evaluation to make effective decisions from informati on-
seeking to solution assessment (Biswas et al., 2016). Recen t experiments showed how scaffolding SRL behavior needs
to be strategically tailored to speciﬁc learning contexts a nd proﬁciency levels (Munshi et al., 2023). Overall, some
research and PL solutions elegantly apply learning science and support some of the goals of modern education.
Nevertheless, we explicitly differentiate research-base d ITS solutions from the personalized learning platforms th at
i) do not employ dialogue-based tutoring and ii) are not spec iﬁcally designed to develop SRL, metacognition, col-
laboration, or other general competence. Similarly to othe r researchers, we call the PL systems that primarily focus
on effective domain-knowledge delivery “adaptive learnin g systems” (e.g., Brod et al., 2023; Järvelä et al., 2021;
Molenaar, 2022a).
3 Challenges of personalized learning systems
3.1 Individualization
In the current approach to PL, learners interact individual ly with an adaptive learning system that sequences learning
objectives and paces instruction according to individual n eeds (Figure 1A). Compared to traditional one-size-ﬁts-al l
approaches, tailoring learning content to individual lear ners has been shown to increase scores and learning efﬁcienc y
(Cui et al., 2018; St-Hilaire et al., 2022; Tetzlaff et al., 2 021). However, while adaptive learning systems enhance the
acquisition of subject-based knowledge and skills, we ques tion the power of these systems to facilitate collaborative ,
human-human social learning settings. The learning-cente red paradigm stems from social constructivist theory, whic h
posits that learning occurs through social interactions (H endrick, 2020; Palincsar, 1998; Vygotsky & Cole, 1978).
Therefore, learning requires shared knowledge constructi on and collaboration (Hadwin et al., 2018). Although AI has
been used to support collaborative learning processes (Tan et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2023) and strong theoretical and
practical foundations have been laid by the ﬁeld of Computer -Supported Collaborative Learning (Rosé & Ferschke,
2016; Hernández-Sellés et al., 2019; Jeong et al., 2019), PL systems are speciﬁcally designed to empower independent
problem-solving and free learning from space and time const raints (Biswas et al., 2016). Face-to-face collaborative
learning is seldom supported by PL systems (Han et al., 2021) . Critically, PL is not about separating students to learn
alone at their preferred pace (Miliband, 2006). Instead, th e desired learning is collaborative and exercised in social
contexts with peers, teachers, families, and communities ( Figure 1B) (OECD, 2019c; Walkington & Bernacki, 2020).
3.2 Focus on performance
PL systems are predominantly subject-based platforms that dynamically adapt instruction to individual learners’ cha r-
acteristics, such as learning style and ability, to maximiz e learning achievement (Capuano& Caballé, 2020; Kerr,
2016). While recognizing the extensive research done by lea rning psychologists behind some ITS mentioned above
(Azevedo & Aleven, 2013; Azevedo et al., 2022; Aleven et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 2009; Roll et al., 2007; Biswas
et al., 2005; Leelawong & Biswas, 2008; Biswas et al., 2016; d u Boulay, 2019; Munshi et al., 2023), the adaptive
learning/personalized learning literature has overwhelm ingly focused on learning achievements, and only a fraction
measure other cognitive aspects such as higher-order think ing and collaboration/communication (Xie et al., 2019).

system tailors learning content to individual learners to i mprove their performance. This approach is mainly effectiv e
in improving the learning of subject-based knowledge. bThe goals of modern education require a collaborative
learning environment where learners can share ideas, recei ve and give feedback, and co-regulate. Figure adapted from
(Winter, 2018) with permission from John Wiley and Sons.
In other words, the main goal of most PL technologies is to inc rease learning efﬁciency (Li & Wong, 2021). The
efﬁciency of adaptive learning systems is measured by the in crease in learning gains in a given time, i.e., the differ-
ence between pre- and post-test scores. Studies of adaptive learning platforms show their efﬁciency over non-adaptive
approaches when measured by student scores and learning spe ed (Ma et al., 2014; Steenbergen-Hu & Cooper, 2014;
Roschelle et al., 2016). First, the gain in efﬁciency is rema rkable. For example, students instructed by Yixue (Squirre l
AI) scored up to 456% higher in less time than students in trad itional classrooms (Cui et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018;
H. Li et al., 2018). The AI-powered PL platform Korbit showed 2.5 times higher scores compared to a non-adaptive
Moodle course (St-Hilaire et al., 2022). The Rimac physics t utoring system has been shown to produce better learning
outcomes for high and low prior knowledge students when the s ystem has a dynamic student model compared to a
non-adaptive one (Katz et al., 2021, p. 202). A meta-analysi s of post-test scores found that intelligent tutoring syste ms
for medical practice and physics had the same effect size as 1 :1 human tutors (VanLehn, 2011). While the efﬁcient
acquisition of foundational knowledge is certainly commen dable, it is essential to recognize that modern education
aims to achieve more than just higher scores in less time. Con versely, a focus on performance is often associated with
traditional, teaching-centered classrooms, where factor s such as learner self-regulation, agency, well-being, and con-
ceptual understanding may not be given the same level of prio rity. Notably, there is a major concern with the exclusive
focus on learning performance.
A century of experimentation has shown that it is critical to distinguish learning - the long-term ability to exhibit new
behaviors and knowledge - from performance - temporary ﬂuct uations in knowledge and behavior measured during
acquisition (Metcalfe et al., 1994). An integrative review illustrates why performance is a highly imperfect index
of long-term learning (Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015). First, th e authors provide extensive evidence that learning can
occur without changes in performance. For example, accordi ng to a well-documented psychological phenomenon
called “latent learning,” learning often becomes visible o nly after a reward or incentive is provided (Tolman & Honzik,
1930). These early results have been conﬁrmed in human studi es and suggest that latent learning, i.e., learning that
does not improve performance, may be more effective than lea rning in which rewards (e.g., scores) are given at the
beginning of the learning experience. Second, Sonderstrom and Bjork show how changes in performance may not
correspond to changes in understanding. For example, repea ting the same content over and over (massing) improves
short-term performance but does not improve long-term lear ning. Lastly, the authors show that errors and mistakes are
often interpreted as a decrease in performance but actually improve long-term retention and transfer (Soderstrom &
Bjork, 2015). In summary, measures of performance during ac quisition may not be indicative of lasting learning, and
measures that show degraded performance during learning ma y improve long-term retention and transfer (Metcalfe et
al., 1994).

3.3 Domain-speciﬁc knowledge
The predominant focus of adaptive learning platforms is on s peciﬁc subjects, such as computer science and engineering
(35%), mathematics (20%), and foreign languages (10%) (Ezz aim et al., 2022; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019; Zhang
& Aslan, 2021). Some ITS have enabled learning by doing in STE M subjects and provided students with elaborate
problem-solving opportunities (Koedinger et al., 2015). H owever, even these innovative solutions remain subject-
speciﬁc because of their architecture and reliance on the do main content model (Doignon & Falmagne, 2012; Zhang
& Aslan, 2021). The domain model serves as a knowledge space, forming a connected graph of domain-speciﬁc
knowledge components (Bartl & Belohlavek, 2011). However, given the quantitative nature of these knowledge graphs,
these learning systems are signiﬁcantly constrained in the breadth and depth of what could be effectively learned (Essa ,
2016). Consequently, PL can only support the effective acqu isition of foundational knowledge and skills (Pedaste &
Leijen, 2018). Although core knowledge forms the essential building blocks of understanding, the evolving demands
of the modern world also necessitate the cultivation of non- epistemic competencies (UNESCO, 2022).
It is not apparent how these non-epistemic competencies, of ten labeled as 21st-century skills, ﬁt into the model of
mastery-based adaptive learning (Tuomi, 2023). From the pe rspective of knowledge graphs, the concept of optimizing
“soft skills” and the feasibility of their assessment throu gh error-correcting and automated assessment remains an op en
challenge (Shemshack & Spector, 2020). For example, what qu estions would effectively gauge a student’s mastery of
critical thinking and creating new value? Incorporating co mpetencies, such as critical thinking, into knowledge spac es
can be a formidable undertaking. Adaptive learning systems are inherently limited to machine-assessable knowl-
edge and skills. To unlock their potential, learners must cr eatively extend their learning outside the subject domain
(UNESCO, 2017). Developing creative and novel ideas requir es opportunities for experimentation, exploration, and
problem-solving beyond the boundaries of the majority of th e existing adaptive learning systems (Stanley & Lehman,
2015; Turner, 2014).
Technically, the purportedly “personalized” learning pat hs fall short of delivering the freedom and choice behind PL
(see Hopkins, 2010). Precisely because being limited to the same underlying knowledge spaces, AI-recommended
learning paths are merely different routes for mastering th e same knowledge at an individualized order and pace. In
that regard, PL systems seem to optimize the traditional edu cational system without providing learners much agency
and customization for setting their goals outside the provi ded task and existing subject domain.
3.4 Limited agency and learning skills
Rather than blindly following the predeﬁned sequence of lea rning objectives, OECD Learning Compass 2030 em-
phasizes the need for learners to navigate unfamiliar conte xts and ﬁnd direction through their own agency (OECD,
2019c). Learners with agency and proﬁcient SRL skills can se t learning goals, choose actions toward them, and adjust
their strategies when needed (Jarvis, 2004; UNESCO, 2017; W inne, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2021). Numer-
ous studies have shown the importance of self-regulation fo r effective learning in distant, e-learning, digital, or ot her
self-directed learning situations (Barnard-Brak et al., 2 010; Bail et al., 2008; Hofer & Yu, 2003; Azevedo et al., 2009;
Puzziferro, 2008). Hence, there is a strong consensus that s upporting learners’ agency and ability to self-regulate
should be the priority of adaptive learning systems (Brod et al., 2023; Järvelä et al., 2021).
As described above, great ITS exist that speciﬁcally develo p student self-regulation, agency, and other more generic
competencies besides subject-domain expertise. However, even the most sophisticated adaptive learning solutions
(not the ITS mentioned above) do not support learners’ agenc y and self-regulation (Molenaar, 2022a). Moreover, PL
requires students to possess self-regulated learning skil ls to effectively learn individually. Recognizing this iss ue, one
K-12 adaptive platform allows students lacking self-regul ated learning training to override the platform’s suggesti ons
(Cukurova et al., 2023). Notably, a recent study of a well-st udied learning platform showed a signiﬁcant decline in
students’ self-regulated learning skills while working wi th the system (Harati et al., 2021).
Dignath and Veenman (2021) bring out four essential precond itions that enhance SRL: self-direction (decision-making
freedom), cooperative learning (students work together), constructive learning principles (e.g., problems have sev eral
solutions), and fostering transfer (learning is integrate d into a real-life context). Similarly, information-theor etically, a
system is autonomous when (i) it is not determined by its envi ronment and (ii) it determines its own goals (Bertschinger
et al., 2008). Because recommendation engines effectively control learning goals, content, sequence of tasks, etc., t hey
potentially reduce the learner’s agency and take away the fr eedom required for developing healthy SRL skills. The
need for agency over one’s learning can be illustrated by the classic experiment (Figure 2A) in which only the kitten
that could exhibit self-directed movements developed norm al vision (Held & Hein, 1963). Similarly, if the learner
is passively moved along the prescribed learning path, he or she may not acquire normal learning and self-regulation
(Figure 2B). The lack of support for learner’s learning skil ls in some adaptive learning systems has been mentioned
previously (Pedaste & Leijen, 2018). Although a framework f or the adaptive assignment of agency (Brod et al., 2023)
5APREPRINT - APRIL 4, 2024

Like the kittens, only learner A would develop agency and sel f-regulated learning skills.
and a prototype for the transition from AI regulation to self -regulation in adaptive learning systems (Molenaar, 2022a )
has been proposed, real-world implementation of these appr oaches is needed to improve learning outcomes and keep
learners motivated and engaged (Ryan & Deci, 2020).
3.5 Engagement and motivation from gamiﬁcation
Decades of research have shown that learning occurs when the learner’s mind is actively engaged in the learning
process (Dehaene, 2020). Broadly, to activate their minds, learners need to be behaviorally and cognitively engaged
in their actions: taking notes while reading, writing summa ries, participating in discussions, and solving problems
(Bonwell & Eison, 1991). According to the ICAP framework, th e more cognitively and behaviorally engaged learners
are during learning, the more they learn (Chi & Wylie, 2014). Some adaptive learning systems, such as Korbit,
promote active learning by alternating instruction with in teractive problem-solving exercises, coding exercises, p roject-
based learning, Socratic tutoring, and video lectures (St- Hilaire et al., 2022). However, a common misconception in
the adaptive learning literature is that these systems must incorporate gamiﬁcation, the application of game design
elements such as leaderboards, badges, levels, and points, in non-game settings to increase engagement (Dicheva et
al., 2015; Maghsudi et al., 2021).
In this context, an important distinction has been made betw een extrinsic and intrinsic motivation (Buckley & Doyle,
2016; Mekler et al., 2017; Ryan & Deci, 2000). Extrinsic moti vation stems from extrinsic rewards (e.g., badges, points,
or even grades), whereas intrinsic motivation is an inheren t interest and enjoyment in anticipating and obtaining new
information (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Decades of research have sh own that students must be intrinsically motivated to be
engaged for extended periods (Deci et al., 2001; Oudeyer et a l., 2016). Furthermore, direct attempts to control learn-
ing outcomes through extrinsic rewards and evaluations typ ically result in lower-quality motivation and performance
(Ryan & Deci, 2020).
In principle, when designed according to the principles of c ognitive psychology, educational games can effectively
support intrinsic motivation by directing children’s atte ntion to the content and stimuli (Dehaene, 2020). Games can
give students the freedom to fail, choose their next actions , provide rapid feedback, and often offer social engagement ,
all of which support learning (Dicheva et al., 2015). For exa mple, adding quests to a foreign language course elicited
long-term intrinsic motivation and made the course more enj oyable, challenging, and meaningful (Philpott & Son,
2022). However, the effect of game elements on learner motiv ation in educational settings varies greatly depending on
the speciﬁc gamiﬁcation element (Sailer & Homner, 2020).
Firstly, much evidence suggests that rewards, incentives, and competition can decrease intrinsic motivation (Deci
et al., 2001; Hanus & Fox, 2015; Ryan & Deci, 2020). For exampl e, a comparison of a social networking site
6APREPRINT - APRIL 4, 2024
and a gamiﬁed learning management system found that gamiﬁca tion increased competition and decreased student
collaboration, sharing, and participation (de-Marcos et a l., 2014). Courses gamiﬁed with leaderboards and badges
have been shown to lower ﬁnal exam scores and decrease intrin sic motivation compared to non-gamiﬁed classes
(Hanus & Fox, 2015). An experiment examining the speciﬁc eff ects of individual gamiﬁcation elements showed that
points, leaderboards, and levels did not affect intrinsic m otivation and only increased the performance quantity (Mek ler
et al., 2017). A meta-analysis found psychological effects of gamiﬁcation, such as increasing enjoyment, fostering
enthusiasm, and satisfying learners’ need for recognition while providing no additional beneﬁt and sometimes causing
anxiety and jealousy (Bai et al., 2020). In summary, some gam iﬁcation elements, such as leaderboards and badges,
may decrease intrinsic motivation while providing no addit ional beneﬁt.
Secondly, while there is sufﬁcient evidence that gamiﬁcati on impacts learning outcomes, there is a paucity of data
on the long-term beneﬁts of gamiﬁcation applied in educatio nal settings (Dichev & Dicheva, 2017). At the short-
term performance level, two recent meta-analyses found a po sitive medium correlation between gamiﬁcation and
learning outcomes (Huang et al., 2020; Sailer & Homner, 2020 ). However, the impact of individual gamiﬁcation
elements on learning has been less studied (Dicheva et al., 2 015). One of the more recent meta-analyses showed how
including game ﬁction/storytelling and collaborative soc ial interactions has a small positive effect on behavioral, but
not cognitive and motivational, learning outcomes (Sailer & Homner, 2020). The second meta-analysis showed large
effect sizes when collaboration and quests/missions/modu les were included in the intervention and more signiﬁcant
effects when some elements, such as leaderboards and timed a ctivities, were excluded (Huang et al., 2020).
Taken together, a scarcity of theoretical foundations mark s the application of gamiﬁcation in education, inconsisten t
empirical ﬁndings, and poor experimental design (Seaborn & Fels, 2015). In addition, a recent longitudinal study
showed that even well-designed educational games may not ha ve sustained beneﬁts for educational goals (Potier
Watkins & Dehaene, 2023). Hence, designers of PL technologi es need to exercise caution when considering integrating
both gamiﬁcation elements and games into computer-based le arning environments. As an alternative to gamiﬁcation,
solid evidence supports active learning methods’ effectiv eness in eliciting intrinsic motivation and enhancing deep
understanding, motivation, and creativity (Chi & Wylie, 20 14).
4 Beyond adaptive learning systems
Our analysis of adaptive learning systems reveals a mismatc h with the educational goals set out in the OECD Learning
Compass 2030 (OECD, 2019b). While adaptive learning approa ches effectively foster foundational knowledge and
skills, they are limited in enhancing learners’ agency, gen eral competencies and activating learners’ minds. However ,
recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs, such as Chat GPT) may address some of these issues and enable a
reset of personalized learning approaches (Kasneci et al., 2023).
4.1 Potential of LLMs
The potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in supporting the goals of contemporary education is demonstrated by
research on intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), a sub-cate gory of adaptive learning systems that provide personalize d
instruction through natural language (speech or text) dial ogues inspired by human tutoring strategies (VanLehn, 2006 ;
Nye et al., 2014). While ITS are fundamentally limited to dom ain-speciﬁc knowledge and suffer from some of the
same problems as other adaptive learning systems (VanLehn, 2011; Mousavinasab et al., 2021), some ITS solutions are
speciﬁcally developed to foster more general competencies (Benvenuti et al., 2023). Speciﬁcally, much research has
been done on ITS that promote student self-regulation and me tacognition (Duffy & Azevedo, 2015; Jones & Castellano,
2017; Azevedo et al., 2022; Roll et al., 2007; Daradoumis & Ar guedas, 2020), especially when accompanied by open
learner models that tacitly invite learners to regulate lea rning (Long & Aleven, 2017; Winne, 2021). Other ITS
solutions have been shown to improve argumentation skills ( Wambsganss et al., 2021) and facilitate collaborative
learning (Haq et al., 2020; Diziol et al., 2010; Han et al., 20 21).
Extending the promising potential of LLMs in education, the ir domain-agnostic architecture and natural language com-
prehension offer opportunities to address the limitations of adaptive learning systems and facilitate modern learnin g
experiences. By prompt engineering LLMs (Peng et al., 2023) , the models could be used in educational settings to
provide more general personal tutoring (Jeon & Lee, 2023; Ka sneci et al., 2023). Speciﬁcally, ITS has been using cu-
rated content and predeﬁned dialogues (e.g., Azevedo et al. , 2022), which could be improved by having more dynamic
content and feedback to students (e.g., Abdelghani, Wang, e t al., 2022). With proper instructions, LLM-based chat
and voice bots could promote learners’ self-regulation and enhance conceptual understanding (Abdelghani, Oudeyer
et al., 2022). Similarly to speciﬁc ITS solutions, LLMs coul d act as pedagogical agents and prompt learners to engage
in speciﬁc cognitive and metacognitive self-regulation st rategies that increase learning effectiveness beyond simp le
knowledge acquisition (Dever et al., 2022; Azevedo et al., 2 022; Wu et al., 2023). LLMs-based pedagogical agents
7APREPRINT - APRIL 4, 2024
could be tailored to guide learners through the Anticipatio n-Action-Reﬂection cycle by asking them to anticipate the
consequences critically and reﬂect on their actions (Brod e t al., 2018; OECD, 2019a).
While research on LLMs is ongoing, several examples offer pr omising conﬁrmation of their potential. For example,
prompt responses to students’ questions using a ChatGPT-ba sed solution have been shown to support self-regulated
progress and knowledge construction and increase intrinsi c motivation and behavioral engagement compared to tra-
ditional Google searches (Wu et al., 2023). Another recent G PT-3-driven conversational agent helped learners gen-
erate more divergent questions and increased their intrins ic motivation compared to manually predeﬁned curiosity-
prompting systems (Abdelghani, Wang et al., 2022). Perhaps we are no longer “a long way from systems being able to
have natural language dialogues with learners about their i nterests in a topic and their potential willingness to put ef fort
in that day” (du Boulay, 2019). LLMs-based AI assistants cou ld play a learning-enhancing role if they focus on activat-
ing learners’ minds, developing learners’ self-regulatio n skills, and supporting collaborative learning rather tha n being
a homework-solving tool. In other words, LLMs could be a “for ce multiplier” for student learning if implemented
carefully and thoughtfully in the service of evidence-base d learning practices (Mollick & Mollick, 2023).
Another promising avenue for LLMs could be assisting teache rs and promoting personalized learning activities in more
collaborative settings. LLMs could help teachers orchestr ate collaborative learning activities (Hadwin & Oshige, 20 11;
Kasepalu et al., 2022) by supporting learner-learner and tu tor-group interactions (Walker & Ogan, 2016; Haq et al.,
2020; Mena-Guacas et al., 2023). A recent study showed how te achers use OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a partner for students
in interactive role-playing, recommending and differenti ating learning materials, acting as a teaching assistant (e .g.,
correcting grammar), and preparing and evaluating tests (J eon & Lee, 2023). A recent study showed how to integrate
ChatGPT into realistic K-12 classroom learning settings wh ere students are positioned as active agents in their learni ng,
building upon each other’s ideas to advance collective unde rstanding and solve authentic problems (Chen & Zhu, 2023).
In addition, ChatCPT could support evidence-based teachin g strategies, including revealing student misconceptions ,
distributed practice, continuous testing, and assessment of student learning (Mollick & Mollick, 2023). In summary,
LLMs have promising potential to support both learners and t eachers in personalizing learning content in scientiﬁcall y
proven ways.
4.2 Towards a hybrid model
The future of formal education is likely to be a hybrid model o f reciprocal interactions between humans and AI rather
than a fully automated system (Molenaar, 2022b). In order to effectively self-direct their learning and keep learning
throughout life (e.g., using ChatGPT), learners must have t he relevant self-regulation skills that enable them to lear n
independently (Sutarni et al., 2021; Theobald, 2021; van Al ten et al., 2020). The paramount importance of self-
regulation skills was exposed during distance learning pro mpted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings indicate a
positive correlation between an individual’s self-regula tion skills and satisfaction, well-being, performance, an d self-
efﬁcacy during distance learning (Jia, 2022; Peteros et al. , 2022; Sutarni et al., 2021). We recognize that a system-wid e
effort to support self-regulated learning is needed for the hybrid model (Hopkins, 2010; Molenaar, 2022b). Resources
should be directed towards training children in SRL skills a s early as possible, preferably in the preschool years, whic h
is the most inﬂuential period for such training (Dignath et a l., 2008; Kochanska et al., 2001; Mofﬁtt et al., 2011; Muir
et al., 2023).
Because SRL skills develop with age (Panadero, 2017), the yo unger the learner, the more collaborative and socially
rooted the learning environment should be. Conversely, the older the learner, the more effectively they could use AI
assistants for their learning (Figure 3). In the early years , learning should be more social, involving interactions wi th
peers, parents, teachers, and the community to develop SRL s kills (Zimmerman, 2000). Collaborative learning is at
the heart of learning-centered education and is part of deve loping general competencies such as critical thinking and
complex problem-solving skills (Hadwin et al., 2018; Hendr ick, 2020). One could also imagine that because LLMs
are neither transparent nor robust, the less self-regulato ry a learner is (i.e., less critical thinking, self-monitor ing, etc.),
the more important a teacher’s role is in detecting errors th at LLMs unknowingly create (Hlosta et al., 2022). Because
the need for relatedness, i.e., a sense of connection and bel onging, is fundamental to human motivation, wellness,
and academic performance, there will always be a portion of l earning that needs to be grounded in social interactions
(white portion of Figure 3; Ryan & Deci, 2020).
5 Conclusion
This paper explored the AI-driven approach to personalized learning, particularly the adaptive learning systems that
focus primarily on effective domain knowledge acquisition . Our analysis focused on the goals of modern learning-
centered education set out in the OECD Learning Compass 2030 : fostering students’ agency and self-regulation skills
for lifelong learning, developing general competencies (s uch as creating new value), and cognitive activation of the

Figure 3: Human instructors are needed to support learners w ith limited self-regulated learning skills. Younger stu-
dents require more guidance and a social learning environme nt, while older students require less assistance. AI assis-
tants can be most effective for learners who exhibit speciﬁc self-regulation skills.
learners’ minds (OECD, 2019b). Although much research has b een done to develop educationally sound ITS, these
research areas are largely neglected in the literature on AI Ed for personalized learning. Moreover, even the best ITS
have limited value in the modern classroom. In examining the existing PL literature, we identiﬁed ﬁve discrepancies
between the educational goals and the current technologica l approach to PL. First, PL is predominantly used as a
synonym for individualization, whereas modern education a spires to be highly collaborative and social. Second,
although laudable, the goal of education is not to improve st udent performance but to foster long-term conceptual
understanding through methods that cognitively engage wit h the learner’s mind. While many speciﬁc ITS solutions
are based on educational psychology and are designed to fost er self-regulation, metacognition, collaboration, etc.,
most adaptive learning systems are limited to predeﬁned sub ject-based knowledge, limiting learner creativity and the
development of more general competencies. Fourth, by recom mending learning paths without a deliberate focus on
learner autonomy, PL systems could inhibit the development of healthy learning skills required for lifelong learning.
Finally, we pointed out the need to cognitively engage with t he learners’ minds rather than using gamiﬁcation as a
motivational basis.
Taken together, we recognize a misalignment between the edu cational goals outlined in the OECD Learning Compass
2030 and the current AIEd solutions for personalized learni ng. While adaptive learning systems have proven effec-
tive for effectively acquiring domain knowledge and skills , their limitations become apparent when fostering learner
agency, developing general competencies, and promoting co llaboration. The main impetus behind the technology-
based approach to PL is to provide each student with a virtual tutor similar to human tutoring to solve Bloom’s
2-sigma problem (1984). However, the aspirations of modern education have moved beyond effective knowledge de-
livery, emphasizing the need for developing broader compet encies and skills necessary for lifelong learning, transfe r,
and well-being. From that perspective, PL is not a juxtaposi tion to the traditional one-size-ﬁts-all approach but a mor e
efﬁcient knowledge delivery method.
Why the current approach to PL is highly limited to adaptive l earning requires further analysis. However, it may be
that it is simply more proﬁtable for the multi-billion dolla r market of AIEd (Guan et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2019;
Miao et al., 2021) to apply existing recommendation systems (e.g., those in YouTube, Amazon, TikTok, etc.) rather
than investing in solving serious educational needs and pro blems (Holmes et al., 2022; Reeves & Lin, 2020; Zawacki-
Richter et al., 2019). We are concerned that applying AI with out a deeper consideration of its educational value could
slow educational progress by diverting focus and resources from scientiﬁcally proven changes that need to be made
in education systems. For example, as we have argued above, m oving learners along a prescribed learning path can
rob them of opportunities for playful discovery, limit thei r agency, and ultimately become a barrier to innovation,
creativity, and even happiness (Stanley & Lehman, 2015). As noted nearly a decade ago, AIEd should start with
education goals and then choose the appropriate technology to support PL, not the other way around (Vandewaetere &
Clarebout, 2014).
