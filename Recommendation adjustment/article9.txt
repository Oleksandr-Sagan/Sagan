Abstract
The
use
of
the
open
innovation
paradigm
has
been,
over
the
past
years,
getting
special
attention
in
the
public
sector.
Motivated
by
an
urban
environment
that
is
increasingly
more
complex
and
challenging,
several
government
agencies
have
been
allocating
financial
resources
and
efforts
to
promote
open
and
participative
government
initiatives.
As
a
way
to
try
and
understand
this
scenario,
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
was
conducted,
to
provide
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
scientific
papers
that
were
published,
seeking
to
capture,
classify,
evaluate
and
synthesize
how
the
use
of
this
paradigm
has
been
put
into
practice
in
the
public
sector.
In
total,
4,741
preliminary
studies
were
analyzed.
From
this
number,
only
37
articles
were
classified
as
potentially
relevant
and
moved
forward,
going
through
the
process
of
data
extraction
and
analysis.
From
the
data
obtained,
it
was
possible
to
verify
that
the
use
of
this
paradigm
started
to
be
reported
with
a
higher
frequency
in
the
literature
since
2013
and,
among
the
main
findings,
we
highlight
the
reports
of
experiences,
approach
propositions,
of
understanding
how
the
phenomenon
occurs
and
theoretical
reflections.
It
was
also
possible
to
verify
that
the
use
of
open
innovation
through
social
media
was
one
of
the
pioneer
techniques
of
engagement
between
the
public
sector
and
citizens.
In
conclusion,
the
reports
confirm
that
the
main
challenges
of
this
paradigm
applied
to
the
public
sector
are
associated
with
their
respective
bureaucratic
aspects,
therefore
lacking
a
bigger
reflection
on
the
procedures
and
methods
to
be
used
in
the
public
sphere.

Introduction
Open
Innovation
(OI)
is
a
term
that
was
originally
conceived
in
the
field
of
business
strategy
and
innovation
(Seltzer
&
Mahmoudi,
2013),
being
introduced
by
Chesbrough
(Chesbrough,
Press,
&
Brown,
2003)
as
a
paradigm
shift
that
converged
from
the
traditional
model
of
closed
innovation,
about
the
internal
rigid
control
of
ideas
and
knowledge
resources
inside
an
organization,
to
a
new
open
model
that
seeks
the
effort
of
external
agents
as
a
way
to
incorporate
ideas
originated
outside
of
the
organization
towards
innovation
processes
that
take
place
inside
the
company
environment.
With
a
high
increase
of
successful
cases
in
the
private
sector,
public
organizations
also
started
to
adopt
innovation
processes
aiming
to
expand
the
participation
of
citizens
inthe
public
sector
and
promote
improvement
in
the
quality
of
public
services
provided.
Gascó
(2017)
underlines
that
to
enhance
OI
in
the
public
sector,
Information
and
Communication
Technologies
(ICT)
contribute
a
lot
in
this
process.
Although
extensive
research
on
adopting
OI
in
the
private
sector
has
already
been
carried
out,
fundamental
differences
in
its
implementation
present
a
series
of
challenges
that
demand
a
deeper
investigation.
Regarding
the
innovation
field
in
the
public
sector
(Androutsopoulou,
Karacapilidis,
Loukis,
&
Charalabidis,
2017),
contrary
to
the
private
sector
which
has
the
goal
to
increase
profit,
the
public
sector
aims
to
increase
benefits
for
those
who
are
interested
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
public
services
provided
(
Yang
&
Kankanhalli,
2013).
Thus,
the
importance
of
developing
studies
that
clarify
how
public
institutions
innovate
by
adopting
the
open
innovation
paradigm
comes
to
light.
This
helps
to
increase
the
understanding
of
this
phenomenon
applied
to
the
public
sector
that,
as
pointed
out
by
the
literature,
is
still
depending
on
results
that
demonstrate
its
applicability
in
that
sector.
This
study
presents
a
systematic
review
that
aims
to
analyze
models,
methods
and
approaches
of
how
the
public
sector
has
been
assimilating
the
open
innovation
paradigm
to
promote
innovation,
investigating
the
facilitating
aspects
and
identifying
current
gaps.
With
this
in
mind,
we
designed
the
following
research
question:
•
How
does
the
open
innovation
process
take
place
in
the
public
sector?
From
this
research
question,
other
specific
questions
were
generated,
as
enumerated
below:
RQ1
What
open
innovation
models
for
governments
are
there
in
the
literature?
RQ2
What
are
the
approaches
used
for
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
RQ3
Which
stakeholders
are
involved
in
these
initiatives
in
the
public
sector?
RQ4
What
aspects
influence
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
RQ5
What
is
the
role
of
ICTs
in
open
innovation
processes
in
the
public
sector?
To
answer
these
questions,
a
research
was
conducted
on
the
primary
studies
published
from
2009
to
2020.
We
chose
2009
as
the
starting
date
due
to
the
publication
of
the
US
Government
memo
regarding
data
transparency
and
its
availability
in
an
open
format
(The
White
House,
2009).
The
search
process
resulted
in
a
total
of
4,741
articles,
from
which
37
were
relevant
and
selected
for
the
process
of
analysis
and
extraction
of
data.
Therefore,
the
goal
of
this
article
is
to
discuss
the
innovation
approaches
that
are
being
proposed
and
applied
in
the
public
sector
throughout
these
years,
investigating
the
facilitating
processes
of
these
innovation
practices
and
identifying
current
gaps.
The
contribution
of
this
study
is
to
reflect
on
how
this
paradigm
has
been
incorporated
in
different
public
organizations
throughout
the
years.
This
article
is
organized
as
follows.
In
section
2
we
established
the
concepts
that
set
the
ground
to
the
analysis
that
was
carried
out.
In
section
3
we
presented
the
main
elements
of
the
literature
method
of
review
that
was
used.
In
section
4
the
results
of
thereview
are
presented,
answering
the
five
research
questions
presented
above.
In
section
5,
we
conducted
a
discussion
regarding
the
obtained
results,
future
works
and
final
considerations.

2.1
Open
Innovation
Open
Innovation
is
a
concept
that
was
initially
conceived
in
the
business
strategy
and
innovation
field.
It
is
referred
to
the
rational
effort
from
companies
to
incorporate
ideas
that
originated
outside
the
companies,
into
innovation
processes,
towards
the
institution,
or
to
promote
internal
ideas
for
a
commercial
application
(Seltzer
&
Mahmoudi,
2013).
Differently
from
the
traditional
closed
innovation
model,
where
innovation
was
developed
and
disseminated
by
organizations
without
the
cooperation
from
third
parties
(Chesbrough,
Vanhaverbeke,
&
West,
2006),
open
innovation
seeks
the
engagement
of
users
with
the
purpose
of
thinking
of
innovation
as
a
way
to
increase
awareness
inside
companies
or
organizations.
The
open
innovation
model
was
originally
presented
by
Henry
Chesbrough
(Chesbrough
et
al.,
2003)
and,
based
on
the
author,
the
concept
of
openness
is
related
to
the
idea
that
innovation
can’t
be
achieved
in
an
isolated
manner
since
there
is
a
dependency
on
several
partners
in
order
to
collect
ideas
and
resources.
Among
the
several
meanings,
open
innovation
may
be
understood
as
a
process
where
knowledge
flows
through
organizational
frontiers
(
West,
Salter,
Vanhaverbeke,
&
Chesbrough,
2014).
These
flows
can
be
sorted
by
two
classifications:
1)
inbound
-
imported
from
outside
into
the
organization,
thus
accelerating
the
internal
development
through
sources
of
knowledge
that
are
acquired
externally,
and;
2)
outbound
-
from
inside
towards
outside
the
organization,
providing
ideas
and
technologies
through
intellectual
property,
licenses
or
patents,
developed
internally,
to
share
with
external
agents
(Chesbrough
&
Crowther,
2006).
Open
innovation
consists
of
an
emergent
model
of
innovation
that
incorporates
knowledge
derived
from
external
and
internal
sources,
taking
into
consideration
that
companies
can
and
should
use
external
and
internal
paths
to
the
market
while
seeking
to
improve
their
technology
(Chesbrough,
Vanhaverbeke,
&
West,
2014).
It
is
an
approach
associated
with
opening
an
organization
process,
aiming
to
exchange
experiences,
ideas
and
knowledge
with
partners,
clients
and/or
suppliers
in
their
innovation
and
competitive
strategy
processes
(Enkel,
Gassmann,
&
Chesbrough,
2009).
One
of
the
aspects
that
motivate
this
openness
is
that
companies
that
only
focus
internally
are
at
risk
of
losing
opportunities
since
most
opportunities
are
outside
the
scope
of
their
current
internal
activities
and
they
need
to
connect
with
external
technologies
to
unlock
their
potential
(Chesbrough
et
al.,
2003).
In
the
literature,
open
innovation
consists
of
different
aspects
concerning
the
role
of
the
external
user
included
in
the
innovation
process,
which
has
several
different
names,
such
as
user-guided
innovation
(von
Hippel,
2005),
user
engagement
(Magnusson,
2003),or
co-
creation
(Prahalad
&
Ramaswamy ,
2004).
Despite
different
ways
to
understand
it,
there
is
a
common
denominator:
final
users
are
engaged
in
innovation
or
development
processes
as
active
participants
instead
of
passive
ones
(Dan
Breznitz
&
Rouvinen,
2009).
2.2
Open
Innovation
in
Public
Sector
Open
innovation
boosts
internal
innovation
teams
with
knowledge
spread
around
the
world.
As
the
cornerstone
for
the
future
development
of
any
nation,
the
open
innovation
paradigm
was
expanded
in
all
levels
of
government
(Georghiou,
Edler,
Uyarra,
&
Yeow,
2014),
as
many
governments
around
the
globe
started
to
design
strategies,
develop
innovation
structures
and
link
outcomes
to
their
National
Agenda.
Consequently ,
each
government
entity
uses
its
own
basic
process
to
enable
innovation
in
its
work
environment.
The
use
of
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector
is
frequently
associated
with
the
possibility
of
expanding
citizen
participation
in
the
public
sector,
which
leads
to
the
improvement
or
creation
of
new
public
services
(Barton
Cunningham
&
Kempling,
2009).
The
US
Federal
Government
made
in
2009
an
important
commitment
to
the
Open
Government
Initiative,
allowing
citizens
to
access
government
data
and
to
contribute
with
ideas
and
knowledge
to
formulate
governmental
policies
and
services
of
innovation
(The
White
House,
2009).
An
important
advance
in
international
terms
occurred
in
2011,
with
the
creation
of
the
Open
Government
Partnership
(OGP).
This
organization
was
created
aiming
to
globally
disseminate
and
encourage
good
governmental
practices,
access
to
information,
the
combat
against
corruption,
social
participation
and
the
use
of
new
technologies
to
innovate
government
and
strengthen
governance,
stimulating
countries
to
adopt
practices
that
promote
a
more
open,
effective
and
accountable
public
management
(Open
Government
Partnership,
2022).
Because
of
that,
several
countries
in
the
world
started
to
adopt
practices
to
make
data
available
in
an
open
format
and
to
expand
mechanisms
that
enable
innovation
along-side
citizens.
In
this
regard,
it
is
possible
to
mention
the
Open
Data
Portal
of
the
United
Kingdom
(
https://www .data.gov.uk/
),
which
currently
hosts
27,742
open
databases
clustered
in
14
specific
categories.
The
US
Government
Data.Gov
(
https://data.gov
)
currently
hosts
a
total
of
20,977
public
data
from
a
total
of
153
agencies
involved.
The
Singapore
Government
Portal
(
https://data.gov .sg
),
created
in
2011,
currently
has
a
number
of
1,877
open
databases.
The
De
Publieke
Zaak
(
http://publiekezaak.nl
)
from
the
Netherlands
enables
government
agencies
to
innovate
using
citizens’
insights.
This
has
also
been
explored
by
developing
countries,
and
it
is
possible
to
mention
the
Brazilian
Portal
of
Open
Data
(
https://dados.gov .br
),
which
hosts
a
total
of
12,969
combined
data,
relying
on
the
engagement
of
209
government
organizations.
The
open
innovation
initiatives
started
being
adopted
in
several
countries,
as
an
initial
effort
to
promote
open
practices.
The
availability
of
open
data
is
a
prior
requirement
for
successful
open
innovation
activities
(Thoreson
&
Miller,
2013).
In
the
past
decade,
the
open
innovation
paradigm
has
become
well
known
amongresearchers
and
professionals
in
regard
to
its
use
in
the
private
sector
(Biscotti,
Mafrolla,
Giudice,
&
D’Amico,
2018;
Bogers
et
al.,
2016).
Motivated
by
these
trends
and
by
the
rise
of
successful
cases
of
this
paradigm
in
the
private
sector
(Gasco´
,
2017),
a
growing
number
of
public
institutions
have
been
adopting
this
strategy
(Bommert,
2010;
Georghiou
et
al.,
2014)
with
the
objective
to
engage
citizens
in
the
public
aspects
(Barton
Cunningham
&
Kempling,
2009;
Ferraris,
Belyaeva,
&
Bresciani,
2020),
boost
collective
intelligence,
design
products
and
solve
issues
(Brabham,
2013).
Particularly ,
the
closed
innovation
model
doesn’t
address
the
policy
challenges
that
the
public
sector
organizations
have
to
deal
with,
thus
justifying
the
need
for
the
public
sector
to
adopt
the
open
innovation
model
(Bommert,
2010).
With
the
increase
of
citizen
dissatisfaction
towards
the
State
and
because
they
are
increasingly
more
willing
to
be
involved
in
the
public
sector
procedures,
the
political
agents
need
to
design
new
means
to
enable
the
engagement
of
external
agents
in
the
innovation
processes
of
the
public
sector
through
innovation
techniques
(Schmidthuber
&
Hilgers,
2018).
It
is
also
worth
highlighting
that
open
innovation
in
the
private
sector
is
related
to
the
development
of
physical
products
or
competitive
advantages,
while
the
public
sector
tends
to
concentrate
on
non-monetary
outcomes
(Bommert,
2010;
Kivleniece
&
Que´lin,
2011).
In
general
terms,
divergences
are
related
to
objectives,
since
the
public
sector
applies
its
efforts
to
increase
the
service
performance
and
the
public
value
(Konsti-Laakso,
Hennala,
&
Uotila,
2008),
and
the
private
sector
is
more
focused
on
maximizing
economic
and
financial
outcomes,
thus
expanding
its
competitive
advantage
(Rangan,
Samii,
&
Van
Wassenhove,
2006).

Resear ch
method
For
this
study,
a
systematic
literature
review
was
adopted.
It
is
known
as
a
research
technique
that
follows
a
well-defined
methodology ,
with
properly
documented
steps,
thus
ensuring
the
quality
and
reliability
of
the
obtained
results
(Jamshidi,
Ghafari,
Ahmad,
&
Pahl,
2012;
Reis
&
Prates,
2011).
In
comparison
with
other
types
of
literature
reviews
(for
instance,
narrative
and
scope
reviews),
the
systematic
review
targets
research
questions
with
specific
focuses,
and
with
narrow
pre-established
parameters
that
are
guided
by
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
(for
instance,
topics,
settings,
types
of
study).
Therefore,
it
is
possible
to
extract
data
from
only
the
studies
that
are
included
and
base
a
conclusion
strictly
on
the
evidence
related
to
the
initial
research
questions
(Armstrong,
Hall,
Doyle,
&
Waters,
2011;
Holeman,
Cookson,
&
Pagliari,
2016).
By
following
this
formal
method,
with
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
properly
established,
it
is
possible
to
provide
a
research
review
replicable
with
as
little
bias
as
possible
during
the
review
process
of
the
research
findings.
This
study
was
based
on
the
guidelines
proposed
by
Kitchenham
(2004)
and
the
procedures
carried
out
were
guided
by
the
following
perspectives:
1.
Characterization
of
the
research
terms;2.
Choosing
the
sources
(search
engines)
in
which
searches
will
be
conducted;
3.
Applying
the
terms
in
the
search
engines;
and
4.
Selecting
primary
studies
through
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
application
criteria
in
the
research
results.
3.1
Resear ch
questions
Establishing
research
questions
is
one
of
the
main
differences
that
distinguish
a
systematic
review
from
a
traditional
one.
Establishing
predefined
questions
helps
to
structure
the
review
and
guides
the
reviewing
process.
This
includes
the
techniques
used
to
identify
studies,
the
critical
review
of
the
studies
and
the
analysis
of
the
results.
The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
analyze
models,
methods
and
approaches
on
how
the
public
sector
has
been
using
the
open
innovation
paradigm
to
promote
innovation,
investigating
the
processes
and
procedures
that
facilitate
practices
and
identifying
current
gaps.
For
that
reason,
the
following
general
research
question
was
designed:
1.
How
does
the
open
innovation
process
takes
place
in
the
public
sector?
This
general
research
question
was
divided
into
more
specific
questions,
as
follows: 
RQ1
What
open
innovation
models
for
governments
are
there
in
the
literature?
RQ2
What
are
the
approaches
used
for
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
RQ3
Which
stakeholders
are
involved
in
these
initiatives
in
the
public
sector?
RQ4
What
aspects
influence
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
RQ5
What
is
the
role
of
ICTs
in
open
innovation
processes
in
the
public
sector?
3.2
Data
sources
and
search
strategy
To
plan
and
execute
this
review,
an
exhaustive
and
wide
search
of
primary
studies
was
carried
out.
The
necessary
data
to
answer
the
research
question(s)
were
extracted
and
classified.
Figure
1
illustrates
the
review
steps.
Figure
1.
Review
steps.
To
assure
the
effectiveness
of
the
search
string,
two
strategies
were
adopted:
(I)
a
preliminary
search
was
carried
out
in
Google
Scholar
about
research
that
would
involve
government
and,
subsequently ,
open
innovation.
This
set
of
articles
was
used
as
a
basis
for
the
systematic
review,
in
order
to
compile
the
main
terms
that
would
better
represent
the
research
objectives
proposed.
Two
sets
of
related
terms
were
defined.
The
main
set
of
terms
was
related
to
the
approaches
in
which
studies
would
refer
to
public
agencies
in
the
literature.
The
second
set
of
terms
was
related
to
the
paradigm
of
open
innovation.
To
construct
the
search
string,
all
of
the
terms
were
combined
using
the
boolean
operators
“OR”
and
“AND”.
The
reason
why
these
methods
were
used
to
create
the
investigation
was
to
unite
the
larger
possible
number
of
studies
that
had
used
the
open
innovation
paradigm
in
the
public
sector.
Table
1
presents
the
search
terms
used
in
this
systematic
review.
(II)
The
next
step
in
defining
the
search
strategy
was
to
underline
the
metadata
fields
that
were
more
adequate
for
the
search
string
application.
Aiming
to
reduce
the
number
of
publications
not
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
this
study,
it
was
decided
that
the
search
terms
would
encompass
title,
abstract
and
keywords.

With
the
goal
to
cover
the
largest
possible
quantity
of
pertinent
publications
to
this
theme,
a
survey
on
the
main
electronic

that
are
more
widely
used
in
the

Study
selection
First,
papers
retrieved
in
the
automated
search
were
filtered
based
on
tittle,
abstract
and
keywords.
Some
results
obtained
through
the
strategy
mentioned
could
still
be
irrelevant
to
the
focus
of
the
research
question,
even
with
the
terms
appearing
on
the
specifics
filters.
Therefore,
a
selection
of
studies
had
to
be
carried
out,
retaining
only
results
relevant
in
answering
the
research
question.
Thus,
some
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
were
designed
to
classify
the
articles
during
the
filtering
process.
Each
potentially
relevant
article
was
analyzed
by
two
researchers
and
reviewed
by
a
third
researcher.
The
conflicting
opinions
were
solved
through
online
meetings.
In
the
end,
articles
containing
results
from
the
same
repeated
studies
and
articles
were
removed
to
assure
that
there
were
no
duplications.
Google
Sheets®
was
used
to
register
all
the
steps
of
the
selection
process
in
a
group
of
worksheets,
facilitating
collaborative
work.
Publications
that
met
any
of
the
inclusion
criteria
are
selected
as
primary
studies.
The
inclusion
criteria
are
presented
below:
•
techniques
or
methods
for
using
the
open
innovation
paradigm
in
public
organizations;
•
experiences
or
reports
on
using
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector;
•
limiting
or
encouraging
aspects
for
using
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector;
•
practical
experience
or
proposal
to
use
theoretical
models
for
using
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector;
Publications
that
met
any
of
the
following
exclusion
criteria,
as
follows,
were
removed
from
the
review:
•
studies
that
are
not
related
to
the
investigated
topic;
•
studies
not
written
in
English;
•
duplicated
studies;
•
studies
that
are
not
available
for
download;
•
incomplete
documents,
drafts,
interviews,
presentation
slides,
extended
abstracts,
book
chapters
or
congress
proceedings;
•
studies
that
are
focused
on
other
types
of
innovation;
•
studies
focused
on
the
application
of
open
innovation
in
a
general
context
(not
limited
to
the
context
of
the
public
sector);
•
studies
that
were
published
over
11
years
ago
(acceptable:
2009
to
2020);
•
secondary,
tertiary
studies,
or
meta-analysis.
The
selection
process
of
primary
studies
for
this
review
was
carried
out
in
July
2021.
Consequently ,
this
review
included
only
studies
published
and
indexed
before
this
date.
Taking
into
consideration
that
the
articles
of
2021
were
in
process
of
development
andpublication
at
the
moment
this
study
was
been
developed,
they
would
need
more
time
to
be
indexed
by
the
search
base.
Due
to
that,
this
review
did
not
contemplate
the
articles
of
the
year
mentioned
above,
thus
taking
the
replication
aspect
of
these
procedures
into
consideration
for
future
studies.
Only
publications
written
in
English
were
accepted.
The
year
2009
was
selected
as
the
first
year,
since
the
topic
of
open
government
started
to
be
instrumentalized
by
the
White
House
on
December
8,
2009,
thus
becoming
a
mark
in
the
US
and,
consequently ,
leading
to
the
creation
of
the
Open
Government
Partnership
in
2011.
The
availability
and
standardization
of
open
data
was
an
important
step
to
disseminate
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector.
For
this
reason,
we
opted
to
use
this
year
as
the
starting
point,
to
map
out
the
larger
quantity
possible
of
studies
on
this
topic.
To
properly
provide
open
data
is
an
essential
requirement
for
successful
open
innovation
activities
(Thoreson
&
Miller,
2013).
3.4
Overview
of
included
studies
The
application
of
search
string
engines
resulted
in
an
initial
set
of
4,343
articles.
The
results
were
properly
registered,
while
the
duplicated
studies
were
removed
from
the
analysis.
2,985
articles
were
left
after
this
procedure.
After
these
filters,
the
titles
and
abstracts
from
the
remaining
studies
were
manually
reviewed,
removing
those
entries
with
titles
that
indicated
they
were
not
relevant
for
this
review.
From
this
manual
filter,
192
potential
articles
were
left
for
the
next
step.
Finally,
a
full
reading
of
the
studies
was
carried
out,
applying
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
defined
above.
This
procedure
resulted
in
37
studies,
available
in
Appendix
A,
which
represented
our
final
set
of
primary
studies.
Figure
2.
Procedure
for
identifying
primary
studies.
The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
carry
out
a
systematic
analysis
of
the
existent
literature
in
the
field
of
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector.
We
discuss
here
some
literature
statistics
resulting
from
the
conducted
systematic
analysis.
As
illustrated
in
Figure
2,
in
the
year
2009,
only
one
study
was
shown
to
be
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
the
study.
It
was
found
that,
although
no
relevant
literature
was
found
in
the
years
2010
and
2011,
results
increased
significantly
in
the
following
years.
Even
though
a
series
of
open
data
initiatives
had
already
been
established,
as
indicated
in
the
figure,
the
increased
interest
in
reporting
studies
on
the
use
of
open
innovation
in
government
could
be
potentially
connected
to
the
creation
of
the
Open
Government
Partnership
by
the
end
of
2011.
The
year
2017
presented
a
larger
number
of
articles
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
study.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
found
that
in
2019
there
was
a
decrease
in
studies
addressing
this
topic,
which
was
brought
back
in
the
year
2020.

Quality
Assessment
After
selecting
relevant
papers,
we
performed
the
quality
assessment.
This
procedure
was 
also
carried
out
by
two
researchers
and
totally
checked
by
a
third
one,
who
also 
participated
in
the
cases
of
conflicting
evaluations.

Google
Sheets®
was
used
to
manage
all
data
extraction,
analysis,
and
synthesis
procedure. 
The
following
data
were
extracted:
title,
abstract,
keywords,
authors,
affiliation,
year, 
journal,
publisher,
hyperlink
of
publication
and
text
passages
whenever
the
paper
provided 
answers
to
the
research
questions. 
To
analyze
the
data,
we
transcribed
passages
that
answered
each
research
question.
We 
then
followed
an
open
coding
procedure
on
these
passages,
condensing
similar
codes
into 
thematic
categories
as
in
an
axial
coding
procedure.
Finally,
we
tallied
the
frequency
of 
citations
for
each
category.
It
is
important
to
note
that
these
frequencies
do
not
reflect
the 
importance
of
the
category,
but
only
how
many

cite
them.

Results
This
section
presents
a
discussion
of
the
research
results
obtained
during
the
literature
systematic
review.
4.1
Overview
of
the
Studies
The
conduction
of
the
search
string
with
the
sources
selected
for
the
development
of
this
research
occurred
around
July
2021
and
resulted
in
a
total
of
4,741
articles.
From
that
point,
a
filter
was
designed
aiming
to
identify
articles
outside
the
time
range
proposed
for
this
study
(2009
to
2020).
A
total
of
476
articles
were
from
years
before
the
proposed
time
of
reference,
from
1966
to
2008,
thus
being
removed.
Regarding
the
year
2021,
the
search
process
in
digital
libraries
happened
during
that
year,
hence
a
total
of
only
8
studies
were
found
by
the
digital
libraries
from
that
year.
Those
articles
were
then
removed
from
the
analysis
since
this
number
could
not
represent
the
totality
of
studies
carried
out
that
year.
For
this
reason,
4,257
articles
were
left,
distributed
throughout
the
years
2009
to
2020,
as
presented
in
Figure
3.Figure
4:
Total
of
studies
found
by
the
search
string
in
the
digital
libraries.
After
a
preliminary
analysis,
the
next
step
was
to
remove
duplicated
studies,
leading
to
a
total
of
2,985
studies.
The
following
step
began
with
the
verification
of
titles
and
abstracts,
excluding
those
studies
with
goals
not
relevant
to
this
review,
resulting
in
a
collection
of
192
potential
studies.
In
the
end,
a
filter
was
applied
with
the
exclusion
and
inclusion
criteria
of
the
primary
studies.
This
analysis
consisted
of
the
following
reading
sequence:
title
of
studies,
abstracts,
conclusions,
and
the
full
text,
reducing
the
initial
research
corpus
to
37
studies,
defined
as
our
final
collection
of
primary
studies.
We
discuss
here
some
literature
statistics,
resulting
from
the
conducted
systematic
analysis.
According
to
Figure
4,
in
the
year
2009,
only
one
publication
was
considered
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
this
study.
It
was
found
that,
although
no
relevant
literature
was
found
in
the
years
2010
and
2011,
results
increased
significantly
in
the
following
years.
Even
though
a
series
of
initiatives
of
open
data
had
already
been
established,
as
indicated
in
the
image,
the
increase
in
the
interest
in
reporting
studies
on
the
use
of
open
innovation
in
government
could
be
potentially
connected
to
the
creation
of
the
Open
Government
Partnership
by
the
end
of
2011.
The
year
2017
presented
the
larger
number
of
articles
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
study.
Figure
5:
Total
of
studies
selected
by
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria.
Through
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria,
studies
that
were
related
to
results
referent
to
the
use
of
open
innovation
in
the
private
sector
were
removed.
Primary
studies
that
would
only
make
references
or
quotes
about
the
theme,
but
didn’t
address
the
process,
technique,
approach
or
report
of
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector
were
also
excluded.
The
English
language
was
chosen
as
a
criterion
for
primary
studies
since
the
most
relevant
journals
and
events
of
the
field
publish
research
mainly
in
English.
Springer
represented
the
larger
number
of
articles
in
the
preliminary
search
(38.05%),
but
only
one
article
met
the
selection
criteria
for
the
present
study.
On
the
other
hand,
Scopus
had
the
second
larger
number
of
articles
(32.82%)
and
presented
the
largest
percentage
of
acceptance
(56.76%).

Quality
of
Primary
Studies
As
described
previously,
each
study
was
assessed
independently
by
two
researchers 
according
to
six
possible
quality
criteria,
and
eventual
conflicts
were
solved
by
a
third 
researcher.
Table

summarizes
the
quality
assessment,
in
which
the
primary
studies
are 
grouped
according
of
the
quality
score.
Only
two
studies
(I2477
and
I4302)
received
the 
maximum
score.
On
the
other
hand,
five
studies
(I2456,

Questions
To
summarize
the
data
obtained
from
the
systematic
review,
the
results
are
presented
based
on
the
research
questions
as
highlighted
in
the
next
subsections
3.1.
4.3.1
[RQ1]
What
open
innovation
models
for
governments
are
there
in
the 
literatur e?
The
systematic
review
identified
two
studies
that
proposed
a
conceptual
model
to
support
the
innovation
process
in
the
public
sector.
Besides
these
models,
it
was
possible
to
map
out
a
group
of
processes
and
strategies
of
open
innovation
for
public
agencies.
Table
8
lists
these
findings.

The
innovation
model
proposed
by
the
study
[I3791]
involves
the
4
types
of
interestedparties
(government,
companies,
citizens
and
researchers)
performing
an
active
role
throughout
the
whole
lifecycle,
since
the
identification
of
needs
to
a
successful
solution.
The
study
reports
a
wide
range
of
citizens
engaged
in
this
co-creation/co-production:
common
citizens
(students,
neighborhood
residents),
specialists
from
several
fields
(artists,
creative
people,
academics,
entrepreneurs,
technicians,
activists,
business
representatives
–
manufacturers,
tradesmen,
retailers,
consultants),
research
communities
and
other
agencies
from
the
public
sector.
The
study
[I4302]
proposes
the
development
of
an
innovation
model
that
seeks
to
assist
government
agencies
to
identify,
design
and
conceptualize
ideas
in
order
to
promote
improvements
and
explore
new
services
in
a
more
efficient
and
effective
manner.
The
proposed
model
focuses
in
three
main
areas:
(1)
the
type
of
innovation
model,
(2)
the
steps
of
the
process
as
a
whole
and
(3)
the
tools
associated
with
each
step.
The
model
can
be
applied
internally
in
organizations.
It
consists
in
a
structure
of
six
distinct
steps,
including
a
filter,
two
decision
gates
and
iterative
loops
that
are
employed
in
some
stages
to
obtain
decisions
before
advancing
to
the
next
stage.
These
iterations
allow
the
model
to
take
into
consideration
information
from
several
internal
and
external
sources.
Based
on
theoretical
reflections
and
a
case
study
about
a
crowdsourcing
platform,
the
study
[I2765]
identified
that
after
the
government
agencies
defined
their
public
management
problem,
they
go
through
four
distinct
phases
in
an
open
innovation
process:
(1)
generation
of
ideas,
(2)
incubation,
(3)
validation
and
(4)
unveiling
the
selected
solution
and
implementing
(internally)
the
winning
idea.
This
group
of
processes
was
adopted
by
the
studies
[I3442]
and
[I3552].
The
former
incorporated
the
proposed
phases
to
support
a
process
of
open
innovation
that
was
idealized
through
a
case
study.
The
latter
reflected
on
how
the
proper
combination
of
ICT
tools
can
support
the
implementation
of
open
innovation
practices
in
the
public
sector.
Based
on
a
number
of
initiatives,
the
study
[I4154]
identified
three
open
innovation
strategies.
The
first
strategy
consists
of
a
basic
collaboration
step,
where
the
city
involves
other
agents
(city
residents
or
a
specialist)
with
the
objective
to
cocreate
solutions.
In
the
second
proposed
strategy,
the
city
takes
on
the
role
of
the
financing
agency
and
infrastructure
facilitator
for
the
process,
aiming
to
expand
open
innovation
for
the
public
sector.
The
third
open
innovation
strategy
is
observed
in
the
initiatives
in
which
all
interested
parties
are
intimately
involved
throughout
the
collaboration
process.
The
three
open
innovation
strategies
proposed
by
the
study
are
inspired
in
the
inbound,
outbound
and
coupled
flows.

[RQ2]
What
are
the
appr oaches
used
for
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
From
the
initial
group
of
primary
studies,
twenty-four
articles
(64.86%)
provided
answers
on
the
main
approaches
used
for
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector.
The
primary
studies
revealed
a
total
of
ten
approaches,
which
are
summarized
in
Table
9
and
highlighted
below:•
Web
Platforms
(24.32%):
are
commonly
proposed
to
subsidize
the
innovation
process
through
platforms,
forums,
proposing
ideas,
sending
suggestions,
complaints,
and
establishing
communication
and
collaboration
among
those
involved
in
the
process;
•
Social
Networks
(13.51%):
Monitoring
social
networks
and
integration
with
network
communities
were
the
most
reported
types
of
approach.
These
initiatives
had
as
their
main
goal
to
involve
external
agents
in
the
innovation
process
through
these
interactions.
Examining
the
reports,
it
was
possible
to
verify
that
the
government
agencies
that
wanted
to
have
open
innovation
initiated
their
experimentations
using
social
networks;
•
Crowdsourcing
(10.81%):
the
use
of
the
crowdsourcing
technique
was
also
reported
as
an
open
innovation
approach
for
the
public
sector.
It
consists
of
a
challenge,
posted
online,
and
an
award
offered
for
the
best
answer
to
the
challenge.
Among
the
platforms
related
to
the
studies,
it
is
possible
to
verify
Challenge.gov
as
a
well-
successful
experience
in
the
US,
with
the
main
goal
to
support
federal
agencies,
while
promoting
and
expanding
the
use
of
award
competitions
to
identify
innovative
solutions
for
critical
questions;
•
Open
data
(10.81%):
Opening
data
and
making
it
available
in
platforms
allows
for
public
consultations.
Several
government
agencies
have
been
promoting
open
innovation
through
platforms
that
have
data
dictionaries
and
APIs
to
enable
interaction;
•
Gamified
Platforms
(8.11%):
some
studies
report
the
use
of
gamification
as
a
proposal
for
open
innovation,
especially
in
the
preliminary
stages
of
interaction
between
citizens
and
their
city;
•
Hackathons
(8.11%):
the
use
of
programming
marathons,
known
as
hackathons,
became
a
viable
alternative
to
open
innovation
for
agencies
of
the
public
sector.
The
experiences
reported
on
hackathons
are
directly
associated
with
the
opening
of
data,
used
as
a
necessary
input
for
creating
and
proposing
technological
solutions;
•
Crowdstorming
(5.41%):
distributed
and
collaborative
methods
of
brainstorming
were
also
reported
as
an
open
innovation
approach
in
the
public
sector.
The
crowdstorming
approach
consists
of
uniting
the
largest
number
of
ideas
about
a
specific
domain
or
topic.
This
approach
may
be
found
in
initiatives
such
as
the
Office
of
Social
Innovation
and
Civic
Participation
in
the
US
(Office
of
Social
Innovation
and
Civic
Participation,
2022);
•
Technology
(5.41%):
some
articles
present
reports
on
how
technological
features
and
tools
can
support
and
promote
the
implementation
of
open
innovation
practices
in
the
public
sector.
The
results
mentioned
are
summarized
in
Table
9.Table

Approaches
of
open
innovation
used
in
the
public
sector.

Which
stakeholders
are
involved
in
these
initiatives
in
the

thirty
articles
(81.08%)
provided
information
on
the
main
stakeholders
and
their
respective
roles
in
the
open

In
total,
twenty-four
stakeholders
were
catalogued,
and
among
the
selected

citizens,
companies,
intermediaries
and
government
were

The
citizens
have
essential
roles
in
the
open
innovation
processes
and
are
used
as
the
primary
input
for
supplying
ideas
and
solutions
to
the
public
field.
Among
these
roles,
the
studies
classify
the
citizen
as
a
predominant
source
of
external
innovation.
In
one
of
the
studies,
the
city
employed
a
citizen
as
an
internal
facilitator,
or
‘agent
citizen’,
aiming
to
encourage
other
citizens
to
engage
in
the
public
institution
initiatives,
while
supplying
city
managers
and
other
citizens
with
information.
There
were
also
reports
of
open
innovation
processes
in
which
the
public
agency
defined
which
would
be
the
skills
citizens
should
possess
to
meet
their
needs,
especially
developers,
scientists
and
students.

The
literature

highlights
the
involvement
of
private
companies
in
collaborationwith
public
agencies
during
the
processes
of
open
innovation.
The
primary
studies
brought
to
light
a
total
of
8
roles
attributed
to
companies.
Among
those
roles,
private
companies
are
involved
with
the
objective
to
provide
technical
support
and
collaborating
with
the
innovation
process,
thus
being
external

Besides
that,
companies
also

solutions
for
challenges
and
taking

Intermediaries
are
considered
important
supporting
roles
in
the
open
innovation
process
in
the
public
sector.
In
total,
thirteen
articles
reported
eight
types
of
open
innovation.
From
the
number
of
roles
attributed,
it
is
possible
to
highlight
the
use
of
crowdsourcing
platforms,
Living
Labs
and
Urban
Labs.
Crowdsourcing
platforms
are
commonly
used
as
mechanisms
for
obtaining
ideas,
knowledge
and
solutions
for
the
challenges
institutions
face.
These
online
platforms
create
awareness
of
unsolved
challenges
and
unite
citizens
in
a
competitive
scenario
set
to
solve
problems
online.
One
of
the
most
used
crowdsourcing
platforms
for
conducting
case
studies
is
Challenge.gov .
Living
Labs
are
also
set
as
intermediaries
of
open
innovation
and
usually
collaborate
through
lectures,
and
by
giving
support
and
feedback
to
the
public
sector.
Its
activities
are
related
to
building
solutions
for
the
public
scenario,
creating
a
space
in
favor
of
innovation,
and
expanding
the
public
knowledge
on
the
use
of
APIs
and
open
data.
At
last,
Urban
Living
Labs
contribute
directly
to
the
process
of
open
innovation
by
providing
physical
structures
to
citizens,
recruiting
and
maintaining
a
community
of
developers
willing
to
participate
in
innovation
strategies
(e.g.
hackathons,
and
development
contests)
and
acting
as
agents
of
change
in
the
city
halls’
organizational
structures.

the
types
of

Lastly,
the
eleven
primary
studies
revealed
a
total
of
ten
roles
taken
by
government.
Besides
relying
on
the
assistance
of
external
agents,
governments
also
make
use
of
their
own
resources
and
collaborators
to
promote
innovation
along
with
citizens.
Besides
that,
they
also
usually
take
the
role
of
facilitators
and
funders
of
open
innovation.
Studies
also
show
that
government
needs
to
be
involved
and
to
provide
all
the
necessary
support
for
citizens
to
conduct
the
process
of
innovation.
Table
14
lists
these
roles.
The
primary
studies
revealed
other
nineteen
stakeholders,

[RQ4]
What
aspects
influence
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector?
Based
on
the
primary
studies,
it
was
possible
to
verify
the
existence
of
a
group
of
thirty
aspects
that
are
involved
during
the
open
innovation
process.
From
this,
nineteen
aspects
(63.33%)
were
identified
as
possible
aspects
that
promote
open
innovation.
Table

these
promoting
aspects.

Based
on
the
combined
promoting
factors,
it
was
noted
that
collaboration
and
opening
data
presented
a
higher
consistency .
Collaboration
is
viewed
as
a
fundamental
aspect
of
innovation
and
commonly
surges
from
integration
between
government,
civil
society
and
companies,
with
the
objective
to
integrate
external
partners
and
discuss
solutions
when
facing
problems
in
the
public
sphere.
Another
promoting
factor
is
the
availability
of
a
collection
of
open-format
data
in
government
platforms.
Initiatives
of
open
data
promote
a
whole
innovation
ecosystem,
bring
new
business
for
private
companies
and
enable
inputs
for
the
intermediaries
of
open
innovation
(Living
Labs,
Urban
Labs,
among
others).
On
the
other
hand,
eleven
aspects
(36.67%)
were
classified
as
barriers
to
the
open
innovation
process
in
the
public
sector.
Table
17
lists
the
barriers
identified.
From
this
collection
of
barriers
to
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector,
the
ones
with
the
higher
concentration
are:
bureaucratic
factors,
legal
barriers,
limitations
in
the
process
and
resistance
to
opening
data.
The
bureaucratic
aspects
are
closely
related
to
the
condition
of
the
public
sector’s
legislation
for
acquiring
products
and
services.
The
results
show
that
the
traditional
process
of
innovation
is
highly
regulatory
and
follows
rigid
rules
and
regulations,
while
open
innovation
needs
more
freedom
to
operate
within
public
agencies.
Another
key
aspect
is
the
legal
barrier,
as
every
and
any
procedure
to
be
carried
out
in
the
public
sector
needs
a
whole
set
of
regulations
and
approvals
by
other
departments,
which
is
one
of
the
main
barriers
reported.
Other
limitations
are
the
procedures
adopted
to
innovate.
According
to
the
studies,
the
agencies
that
use
innovation
strategies
such
as
hackathons
are
faced
with
insufficient
final
results
for
the
proposed
problem.
Besides
that,
the
next
steps
after
the
competition
weren’t
clear
or
objective,
leading
to
failures
by
the
public
agencies
that
intended
to
implement
those
actions.
Lastly,
another
reported
aspect
is
the
resistance
some
agencies
impose
to
opening
their
databases.
There
were
reports
in
which
the
process
of
opening
data
was
considered
a
‘burden’
and,
therefore,
only
a
few
agencies
gave
priority
to
opening
data.

[RQ5]
What
is
the
role
of
ICTs
in
open
innovation
processes
in
the
public 
sector?
Seventeen
studies
provided
answers
to
RQ5.
The
role
of
ICTs
in
the
processes
of
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector
was
extracted
from
these
articles.
Table
18
lists
the
roles
defined
by
the
studies.
ICTs
are
present
in
the
intermediation
of
the
innovation
process,
in
the
support
of
collaborative
activities,
in
open
data,
availability
of
services,
communication
and
monitoring
of
social
networks.
The
roles
of
intermediation
refer
to
the
use
of
web
platforms
as
innovation
intermediaries,
assisting
to
achieve
solutions
and,
consequently ,
identifying
and
solving
problems.
The
role
to
support
collaborative
activities
was
emphasized
in
the
literature.
The
studies
highlighted
the
usage
of
ICTs
allowing
group
discussions,
sending
comments
and
evaluating
submitted
ideas,
and
the
possibility
of
visualizing
the
ideas
sent
by
other
citizens,
voting,
debating
ideas,
and
online
forums,
among
other
aspects.
The
availability
of
open
data
in
interoperable
format
has
an
essential
role.
Technology
has
also
an
essential
role
in
presenting
services
and
products.
The
studies
highlighted
that
web-
sites
and
mobile
apps
are
used
for
presenting
the
catalogue
of
offered
services,
disclosure
of
databases
and
web
platforms
for
displaying
ideas.
Another
essential
role
in
diffusing
information
is
communication.
Studies
report
that
technology
has
an
important
role
in
the
public
transmission
of
open
innovation
calls.
Lastly,
monitoring
social
networks
has
been
one
of
the
pioneer
strategies
to
engage
citizens
and
government
in
favor
of
innovation.

DiscussionThe
results
of
this
review
suggest
that
open
innovation
can
benefit
Government
institutions 
as
a
strategy
to
address
challenges
and
promote
economic
development.
Key
stakeholders 
of
open
innovation
in
government
include
citizens,
private
companies,
innovation 
intermediaries,
other
governments,
universities,
employees,
non-governmental
and
social 
organizations.
Collaboration
among
these
actors
is
essential
for
co-creating
innovative 
solutions
for
public
problems,
which
can
also
increase
government
transparency
and 
accountability .
Open
innovation
in
the
public
sector
can
lead
to
changes
in
the
way
the
government 
operates,
such
as
using
web
platforms
and
social
networks
to
engage
citizens
in 
decision-making,
crowdsourcing
initiatives,
hackathons,
and
crowdstorming
to
solve 
complex
challenges,
and
opening
data
for
new
business
opportunities,
innovation,
and 
collaboration.
However,
government
institutions
need
to
manage
and
implement
these 
initiatives
properly,
ensuring
privacy
and
security
of
personal
data
and
handling
conflicts 
and
challenges
that
may
arise
during
the
innovation
process. 
Implementing
open
innovation
may
require
cultural
and
organizational
changes,
and 
public
managers
must
be
able
to
identify
opportunities
and
establish
clear
objectives
and 
performance
indicators.
Open
innovation
may
also
require
greater
flexibility
and 
adaptability
from
public
organizations
to
quickly
adjust
to
changes
in
citizens'
and
market 
needs.
Citizens
can
play
diverse
roles
in
open
innovation
processes,
and
technology
plays
a 
crucial
role
in
facilitating
collaboration
and
co-creation
among
different
actors. 
This
review
can
guide
the
development
of
public
policies
that
promote
open 
innovation
and
highlights
the
importance
of
cross-sector
collaboration
and
co-creation
for 
solving
complex
problems.
Public
organizations
should
be
open
to
learning
from
other 
successful
open
innovation
initiatives.
5.1
Practical
and
Managerial
implications
Government
institutions
should
focus
on
promoting
collaboration,
opening
data,
and 
leveraging
ICTs
to
overcome
barriers
and
enhance
open
innovation
processes
in
the
public 
sector.
However,
there
are
practical
implications
for
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector, 
such
as:
●
Proper
articulation
with
institutions
that
play
the
role
of
intermediaries-
it
is 
important
to
involve
intermediaries
that
are
able
to
handle
many
aspects
to
help 
promote
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector.
Governments
should
rely
on
partner 
institutions
that
can
support
them
in
establishing
partnerships
with
civil
society
and 
companies
in
order
to
integrate
such
external
partners
and
discuss
solutions
to 
public
problems; 
●
Appropriation
of
Information
and
communication
technologies-
ICTs
play
a
key 
role
in
open
innovation
processes
in
the
public
sector.
Governments
should 
leverage
the
use
of
web
platforms
as
well
as
use
technology
to
support 
collaborative
activities
such
as
group
discussions,
commenting,
and
evaluating 
ideas.
Governments
should
also
ensure
the
availability
of
open
data
in
an 
interoperable
format,
and
promote
the
use
of
websites
and
mobile
apps
for 
presenting
the
catalog
of
services
and
products.
Communication
through 
technology
and
monitoring
social
networks
can
also
help
in
diffusing
information 
and
engaging
citizens
and
government
in
favor
of
innovation; 
●
Open
data-
Open
data
and
ICT
play
an
essential
role
in
supporting
innovation.
It 
helps
promote
innovation,
expand
public
knowledge,
and
enable
collaborative 
activities.
Making
data
available
on
platforms
allows
for
public
consultations
and 
supports
open
innovation
through
the
use
of
APIs
and
direct
manipulation
of
raw 
data.
Initiatives
of
open
data
also
promote
an
innovation
ecosystem,
which
createsnew
business
opportunities
articulated
by
open
innovation
intermediaries
such
as 
Living
Labs
and
Urban
Labs; 
●
Overcoming
obstacles-
Bureaucratic
factors,
legal
barriers,
limitations
in
the 
process,
and
resistance
to
opening
data
are
major
barriers
to
open
innovation
in
the 
public
sector.
Governments
should
work
towards
reforming
their
legislation
to 
make
the
acquisition
of
products
and
services
more
flexible
and
less
regulatory. 
There
should
also
be
clear
and
objective
next
steps
after
innovation
competitions
to 
avoid
failures
by
public
agencies.
Furthermore,
efforts
should
be
made
to
address 
resistance
to
opening
data,
which
can
be
achieved
by
promoting
the
benefits
of 
open
data
to
public
agencies.
Open
innovation
in
government
institutions
can
provide
a
more
efficient
and
effective 
way
for
the
public
sector
to
identify,
design,
and
implement
innovative
solutions
by 
involving
various
stakeholders
in
the
innovation
process.
The
use
of
open
innovation 
models
and
approaches
is
part
of
strategic
moves
that
can
help
government
agencies
to 
promote
improvements
and
explore
new
services.
There
are
managerial
implications 
involving
the
following
aspects: 
●
Open
innovation
models-
The
choice
of
an
appropriate
model
for
a
Government 
institution'
s
needs
is
key
to
an
open
innovation
strategy.
In
this
review,
two 
conceptual
models
were
identified,
one
involving
four
types
of
interested
parties 
(government,
companies,
citizens,
and
researchers)
playing
an
active
role
in
the 
entire
innovation
process,
while
the
other
proposes
a
six-step
structure
to
assist 
government
agencies
in
identifying,
designing,
and
conceptualizing
ideas
to
promote 
improvements
and
explore
new
services; 
●
Open
innovation
approaches-
The
decision
on
which
approaches
to
put
into
practice 
is
also
strategic.
There
were
several
ICT-centered
approaches
identified,
including 
web
platforms,
social
networks,
crowdsourcing,
open
data,
gamified
platforms, 
hackathons,
crowdstorming,
and

These
approaches
can
be

Stakeholders
involvement-
The
approach
on
how
and
which
stakeholders
to
involve 
in
an
open
innovation
process
concerns
another
strategic
choice
that
can
impact 
managers
and
decision-makers.
The
stakeholders
involved
in
open
innovation 
initiatives
in
the
public
sector
include
government
agencies,
citizens
(common 
citizens,
specialists
from
several
fields,
and
research
communities),
companies, 
researchers,
and
other
agencies
from
the
public
sector.
For
instance,
these
two 
strategy
options
may
go
in
different
directions:
focus
on
having
citizen
engagement 
as
a
primary
goal
or
create
new
businesses
and
foster
the
local
innovation 
ecosystem.
5.2
Conceptual
Model
of
Open
Innovation
applied
in
the
Public
Sector
After
analyzing
the
data
obtained
from
the
research
questions,
we
constructed
a
conceptual 
model
(Figure
6)
that
showcases
the
main
components
that
surfaced
during
our
literature 
review.
The
central
point
of
the
model
is
the
Government
institution,
which
we
assume 
adopts
an
innovation
model
(RQ1)
and
selects
one
or
multiple
approaches
(RQ2)
that
can 
be
applied
at
different
stages
of
the
innovation
process
to
acquire
decisions
before
moving 
on
to
the
next
phase.
These
approaches
commonly
revolve
around
Information
and 
Communication
Technologies
(ICT),
like
a
Web
platform,
Crowdsourcing
or
Hackathons. 
The
ICTs
identified
in
the
model
have
diverse
roles
(RQ3),
including
facilitating
theinnovation
process,
providing
services,
or
acting
as
an
API. 
The
innovation
model
identified
in
the
answer
to
RQ1
involves
the
participation
of 
multiple
stakeholders.
Furthermore,
our
findings
from
RQ5
suggest
that
there
are
barriers 
(e.g.,
bureaucracy)
that
hinder
open
innovation,
but
there
are
also
factors
that
promote
it 
(e.g.,
collaboration).
Overall,
this
conceptual
model
can
serve
as
an
initial
framework
for
understanding 
the
key
elements
of
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector
and
help
guiding
future
research 
in
this
area.
By
identifying
the
factors
that
promote
and
hinder
open
innovation, 
Government
institutions
can
make
informed
decisions
when
adopting
innovation
models 
and
selecting
ICT-based
approaches
to
drive
innovation
forward.

5.3
Limitations
of
this
Review
The
most
common
limitations
in
a
systematic
review
are
potential
biases
introduced
during 
the
selection
process
and
data
extraction
errors.
These
are
the
primary
potential
constraints 
of
this
study.
All
review
stages
were
completed
in
pairs,
disputes
in
the
selection
process 
were
resolved
by
a
third
party
or
in
consensus
sessions,
and
all
justifications
for
including 
and
excluding
studies
at
each
point
were
documented.

Summary
and
conclusions
This
review
analyzed
a
total
of
4,741
studies,
from
which
37
provided
answers
to
the
research
questions.
A
total
of
two
conceptual
models
of
open
innovation
were
identified,
regarding
the
public
sector.
Besides
those
models,
other
studies
were
also
identified
for
proposing
processes
and
steps
to
implement
open
innovation
in
the
public
sector.
Among
the
main
approaches
of
open
innovation,
web
platforms
presented
a
higher
rate
of
reports
among
the
selected
studies.
Regarding
web
platforms,
crowdsourcing
platforms
stood
out.
When
considering
the
main
stakeholders
involved
in
the
open
innovation
initiatives,
citizens
represented
the
larger
intersection
among
the
primary
studies,
confirming
what
is
portrayed
by
the
literature,
with
regard
to
the
involvement
of
citizens
in
these
initiatives.
Among
the
main
influencers,
collaboration
is
one
of
the
main
drivers
of
open
innovation
in
contrast
to
bureaucracy
and
legal
aspects
which
are
the
main
barriers.
As
for
the
main
role
performed
by
technology ,
the
feature
of
supporting
the
open
innovation
process
is
the
most
common
one,
as
pointed
out
by
many
studies.
These
results
present
a
general
perspective
of
how
the
literature
has
reported
the
process
of
open
innovation
in
public
agencies
and
the
main
elements
involved
in
these
processes.
The
results
confirm
that
the
usage
of
the
innovation
paradigm
in
the
public
sector
is
still
a
new
field
and
it
is
still
in
an
exploratory
phase,
needing
more
studies
about
the
systematization
by
the
scientific
community .
Besides,
there
are
barriers
and
challenges
imposed
against
the
innovation
processes,
since
the
public
sector
has
several
guidelines
and
rules
that
prevent
the
proper
usage
of
open
innovation
mechanisms,
leading
to
a
need
for
reflection
on
which
procedures
and
methods
need
to
be
adopted
in
the
public
sphere.
The
implications
of
this
systematic
review
point
toward
the
need
to
structure
models
and
processes
of
open
innovation
in
government
that
could
promote
a
better
articulation
between
stakeholders,
technologies,
platforms
and
processes.
When
looking
deeper
into
these
initiatives
there
are
a
few
explicit
models–
either
intentional
or
unintentional
–
of
open
innovation
being
applied
to
the
public
sector.
This
indicates
that
most
initiatives
are
commonly
carried
out
without
a
structured
process
or
a
concise
methodology ,
being
organized
in
a
rather
exploratory
manner.
In
order
to
be
adopted
or
replicated,
such
models
and
processes
need
to
be
systematically
mapped.
It
thus
reveals
a
gap
to
be
explored
in
research.
To
expand
the
understanding
of
this
topic,
as
well
as
to
promote
future
works,
we
propose
future
studies
to
include
the
perspective
of
the
main
stakeholders
who
are
engaged
in
the
open
innovation
initiative
in
the
public
sector.
We
intend
to
map
the
models
or
processes
they
have
been
following
to
promote
such
initiatives
and
contrast
them
with
what
is
found
in
literature.Appendix
