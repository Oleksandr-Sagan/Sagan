Abstract —Stochastic battery bidding in real-time energy mar-
kets is a nuanced process, with its efficacy depending on the
accuracy of forecasts and the representative scenarios chosen
for optimization. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering
methodology that amalgamates Transformer-based forecasting
with weighted constrained Dynamic Time Warping (wcDTW) to
refine scenario selection. Our approach harnesses the predictive
capabilities of Transformers to foresee Energy prices, while
wcDTW ensures the selection of pertinent historical scenarios by
maintaining the coherence between multiple uncertain products.
Through extensive simulations in the PJM market for July 2023,
our method exhibited a 10% increase in revenue compared to the
conventional method, highlighting its potential to revolutionize
battery bidding strategies in real-time markets.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The energy landscape is witnessing a paradigm shift driven
by the increasing integration of renewable sources, such as
wind and solar. As these intermittent energy sources become
more predominant, the emphasis on grid-level storage to
counteract supply fluctuations is growing exponentially. Such
systems play a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and
managing the variability of renewable sources. Deregulated
global energy markets are undergoing transformative changes
with the surge in grid-level storage adoption [1]. Storage
mechanisms not only stabilize the grid but also provide a
unique financial opportunity through energy arbitrage. This
process, leveraging the buy-store-sell mechanism in response
to electricity price variations, is emerging as a vital component
in justifying investments in grid-level storage. The efficacy of
the investment hinges on the precision of the battery’s bidding
strategies [2], [3].
The intricate nature of bidding in the electricity market
stems from the inherent challenge of maintaining a delicate
equilibrium between supply and demand. To adeptly navigate
this complexity, Independent System Operators (ISOs) and
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) employ multi-
settlement market structures [4], [5]. These structures encom-
pass a spectrum of time horizons, from day-ahead predictions
to real-time adjustments. It is noteworthy that real-time mar-
kets, in their bid to reflect immediate dynamics, settle based
on intra-hour pricing, commonly segmented into 5, 10, or 15-
minute intervals. These settlements occur based on the bidsprovided by the participants. Certain markets, such as NYISO,
PJM, CAISO, and ERCOT, to name a few, not only make
settlements in real-time based on previously submitted bids
but also facilitate real-time bid submission. In these setups,
market participants have the latitude to submit bids every hour,
targeting delivery in the following hour, or in the case of
ERCOT, the current hour [6]–[8].
The challenge of formulating optimal bids that maximizes
revenue by avoiding penalties in real-time electricity markets,
especially in the face of uncertain market dynamics and
fluctuating renewable generation, can be adeptly addressed
through stochastic optimization. This framework seamlessly
integrates probabilities and uncertainties associated with event
occurrences. Such innovative theoretical advancements serve
as the cornerstone for cutting-edge methodologies, and they
have catalyzed a surge of research and literature in this
domain [3], [9]–[11]. A challenge inherent in this approach
is pinpointing a subset of future scenarios that captures the
plausible distribution, ensuring the optimization framework
yields dependable decisions. The complexity amplifies when
these scenarios span multiple periods and incorporate a myriad
of interdependent uncertain variables.
A substantial body of literature exists addressing the cre-
ation of uncertain scenarios in electricity markets, considering
both single and multiple variables across various timeframes.
Many approaches, grounded in heuristics, select historical days
without accounting for foresight [12], [13], thereby making an
implicit assumption that future market dynamics will mirror
historical patterns. While some studies opt for random selec-
tion mechanisms [14], others employ deterministic metrics like
Euclidean distance to refine their subset, risking misplaced
confidence in potentially suboptimal selection [15]. Herding
et al. [3] proposes the use of SARIMA model, which, despite
its prowess in time series forecasting, remains contingent on
accurate hyperparameter identification and may falter in cap-
turing non-linear relationships or unexpected market shocks.
A noteworthy subset of literature incorporates forecasting
methods to generate synthetic scenarios using univariate nor-
mal distributions of error, a choice that might oversimplify
real-world error dynamics. Several studies have enhanced
the reliability of synthetic scenarios for a single uncertainty
using sophisticated deep learning techniques [16]. Though
such approaches are deemed more effective in estimating thefuture than the previous analogue scenarios based methods, an
over-reliance on these forecasts can be precarious, especially
in contexts where preserving interdependencies among multi-
uncertainty is paramount. Therefore, this study exclusively
concentrates on improving the selection of analogous scenarios
from historical data and offers a comparison with the state-of-
the-art method in this specific area.
In summary, in scenario selection for optimizing battery bids
in real-time markets, traditional methods have predominantly
hinged upon heuristics for historical day selection or the super-
imposition of random errors on forecasts, casting doubts over
their encompassing reliability. Such methods might inadver-
tently sidestep certain pivotal scenarios, potentially undermin-
ing the robustness of derived outcomes. However, the advent
of Transformer-based time series forecasting has ushered in
a new era of enhanced prediction accuracy [17]. It should
be noted that the term “Transformer” in this context refers
to the deep learning model, not to a physical transformer.
Simultaneously, the imperative to adeptly cherry-picking anal-
ogous days from historical datasets has showed promise. This
manuscript introduces an innovative method that melds the
prowess of transformer-based forecasting with the precision of
the proposed Weighted Constrained Dynamic Time Warping
(wcDTW) metric. The aim is to pinpoint those historical days
that best mirror contemporary dynamics.
II. M ETHODOLOGY
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the proposed approach.
In Figure 1, we present a schematic of the proposed
methodology. At its core, this approach clusters historically
analogous days — both in terms of similarity and dissimilarity
— employing refined clustering techniques as delineated by
Bhavsar et al. [18], Panda et al. [19], and further expanded
upon by [20]. As depicted, the clustering mechanism ingests
a spectrum of parameters related to market conditions. This
includes calendar attributes, load and renewable forecasts,
historical day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) prices, and
prior ancillary price data. Furnished with these input features,
and invoking diversity measures upon the target variables
(which will be rendered as uncertain entities in the stochasticoptimization process), this phase orchestrates the clustering of
the historical dataset, ensuring it encapsulates the similarity
patterns inherent in the data. A cluster corresponding to
the given market condition is picked for further analysis, as
illustrated by the highlight in Cluster 2 in Fig. 1.
Figure 1 further elucidates how the market parameters serve
as inputs to the Transformer-based model [21] to provide real-
time forecasts. Historically, Transformer architectures have
pioneered advancements in tasks within the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) realm, particularly where capturing tem-
poral dynamics is paramount. This trait makes such models
uniquely suited for forecasting tasks, especially in domains
like electricity pricing, where intricate temporal relationships
exist. In the context of stochastic optimization for electricity
pricing, the Transformer’s ability to discern subtle yet crucial,
time-bound correlations and dependencies offers unparalleled
advantages. Notably, our design renders the output of the
Transformer model probabilistic in nature. Figure 1 highlights
scenarios where decisions pertain to two uncertain products for
battery bidding. The forecasts for these products are illustrated
through a median trajectory, flanked by a lightly shaded
regions, denoting a specific quantile range, thus providing a
comprehensive probabilistic perspective.
Employing probabilistic forecasts for uncertain products is
paramount when identifying a representative subset from a
selected cluster. Notably, clusters can encompass hundreds or
even thousands of timestamps, rendering them impractical for
real-time stochastic optimization. To effectively reduce the
cluster size while honoring the probabilities associated with
extreme events and likelihood measures, it is crucial to not
solely depend on data-driven cluster reduction techniques, as
suggested by Bhavsar et al. [18], or model-based strategies
like those presented by Dupavcova et al. [22]. Instead, our
proposed method innovatively incorporates real-time forecasts
alongside the wcDTW measure, spanning various quantiles
and products. Selection from the cluster hinges on a newly
introduced distance coefficient, rooted in the wcDTW metric.
Entries with the lowest Dcare selected, their probability being
inversely proportional to this metric. The formula for the
proposed Dcis:
Dc=X
pwcDTW p(n, m)·wfp (1)
Where Dcis the distance coefficient for a single historical
timestamp, pis an index variable for various products, wfp
is the weight factor corresponding to product p, which is
either user-defined or can be optimized in backtesting. nand
mrepresent the lengths of two time-series being compared,
which correspond to the dimensions of the wcDTW matrix.
wcDTW p(n, m)is a distance measure between two time
series of product p.wcDTW matrix is populated as:wcDTW (i, j) =

tamp and yq

•Wis the window size constraint.
•wqis the weight of element yq

The weight assigned to each quantile can either be user-
defined or optimized through backtesting. The proposed
wcDTW is based on the DTW concept, utilizing recursion to
calculate the distance between time series. For more informa-
tion on derivation, readers are directed to the DTW literature
[23].
III. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is assessed
within the context of intra-day battery bidding, wherein
decision-makers aim to adjust the bids placed in the day-ahead
market based on the latest information about their energy
production. The stochastic framework employed for evaluation
closely aligns with the one delineated in [11] for optimizing
intra-day bidding. For the sake of simplicity and without loss
of generality, both wfpandwqare user-specified in this anal-
ysis. Specifically, wfpis defined as a one-hot encoded vector
with emphasis solely on the Energy RT product. Conversely,
wqis assumed to follow a normal distribution, with a higher
concentration around medium values and diminishing weights
assigned to the extremes.
In evaluating the efficacy of our proposed components, we
establish a benchmark that selects historical days based on
the similarity of market conditions alone, without incorporat-
ing the Transformer and wcDTW layers. This benchmarking
strategy is consistent with leading methodologies for analogue
scenario selection in literature, as demonstrated by Gomes et
al. [12] and Bhavsar et al. [24]. For a robust assessment of the
scenario set against actual values, we introduce a preliminary
evaluation metric—termed the ’stoch metric’ ( SM). This
metric captures both the mean deviation of scenarios from
true values and their capability to encompass extreme values.”µerror=T−P

where, Wbe the weights vector, Tbe the target value, F
be the ith scenario, µerrorbe the mean error calculated using
weights, Ube the upper bound penalty, and Lbe the lower
bound penalty.
Figure 2 displays ten scenario subsets selected by the
baseline method for the Energy RT product on representative
days and hours: (a) 01/25/2023 09:00H (b) 04/14/2023 17:00H
(c) 07/25/2023 00:00H. The true Energy RT values are repre-
sented by the red lines, while the various scenarios are depicted
in shades of blue, with the intensity of the color indicating
the probability of each scenario; darker hues denote higher
probabilities, while lighter shades suggest lower probabilities.
The abscissa delineates the optimization horizon. Within the
chosen framework, the stochastic optimization agent forecasts
over a 16-hour period to make an optimal decision for the
subsequent hour.
From an analysis of Fig. 2, several observations emerge.
Firstly, the scenarios tend to consistently over-predict, often
reaching unnecessary extremes. Despite this trend towards
over-prediction, the scenarios fail to accurately capture crucial
price spikes, as exemplified in Fig. 2b. Moreover, the scenario
depicted in Fig. 2c illustrates another issue: not only does it
mispredict the magnitude, but it also inaccurately forecasts
the timing of a significant spike. For a more quantitative
assessment, the average SM value for these scenarios was
calculated to be 34.84. These discrepancies underscore the
challenges in effectively modeling uncertainties and emphasize
the need for more sophisticated prediction mechanisms.
Figure 3 showcases the probabilistic forecast of the Energy
RT in the PJM market as generated by the Transformer model.
The solid orange line delineates the median forecast, with
the surrounding shade indicating the respective quantile range.
Similar to previous illustrations, the forecasting horizon spans
16 hours, in line with the agent’s optimization period for the
subsequent day. Notably, the Transformer model exhibits com-
mendable precision in predicting real-time Energy RT prices,
with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approxi-
mately 3 $/MWh. Leveraging such accurate forecasts could
substantially enhance the performance of the stochastic model.
However, a crucial aspect to consider is the multi-product
nature of the optimization. Namely, different participation
scenarios require anticipating not only energy price volatility
for energy arbitrage opportunities, but also ancillary obliga-
tions and real-time ancillary prices, among others. Relying
solely on independent forecasts for each product could disrupt
the inherent coherence among them. This poses the intricate
question: how can we integrate this forecast information toFig. 2. Scenarios of RT energy price from benchmark approach for representative days in PJM market: (a) 01/25/2023 09:00H (b) 04/14/2023 17:00H (c)

guide the historical subset selection more effectively? Our
proposed approach seeks to answer this conundrum, and the
subsequent paragraph delves into the demonstrated efficacy of
scenarios built upon this method.
Figure 4 illustrates the scenarios chosen using our proposed
method, which incorporates both the Transformer model and
wcDTW for selection. Evidently, the chosen scenarios closely
envelop the true value, demonstrating improved precision.
Moreover, the approach effectively addresses previously ob-
served issues such as unwarranted over-predictions, accurate
spike capture, and pinpointing the precise spike occurrence
timings. From a quantitative perspective, the derived average
SM value stands at 27, marking an approximate 22% enhance-
ment in our preliminary assessment metric. This promising
outcome paves the way for a deeper evaluation, conducted by
running a stochastic simulation that determines battery bids in
real-time. The tangible benefits of this improvement are further
expounded in the subsequent section.
A more rigorous assessment of our method is undertaken
by simulating the stochastic optimization process in intra-
day bidding in actual market where the bidding prices are
indeed influenced by the actions and strategies of other market
participants. In this context, the agent determines whether to
charge or discharge the stand-alone battery within the real-timemarket. This decision-making is conducted while adhering to
the inherent constraints associated with the battery’s physical
limitations, market stipulations, as well as ensuring optimal
battery life, managing state of charge (SoC), and complying
with the real-time market’s demand-supply balance. For the
evaluation period spanning the month of July 2023 in the
PJM market, the newly proposed technique yielded a revenue
increase of 10% compared to the preceding methodology.
Table I delineates the revenue stratification based on charging
or discharging activities for the Energy RT product. While
other real-time products, such as ancillaries and regulations,
contribute to the overall results, for the sake of brevity,
we’ve exclusively spotlighted the Energy RT product. An
examination of Table I reveals that our approach augments
profitability by bolstering discharge-driven revenue and dimin-
ishing charge-associated costs. Assessment of SM indicates a
lasting impact and shows that July’s improvement reflects an
annual trend.
CONCLUSION
The article presents a novel approach to intra-day battery
bidding using a combination of Transformer-based forecasting
and weighted constrained Dynamic Time Warping (wcDTW)
for scenario selection. Our methodology leverages the pre-Fig. 4. Scenarios of Energy RT product from the proposed approach for representative days in PJM market: (a) 01/25/2023 09:00H (b) 04/14/2023 17:00H
